<p>In this video, I&#39;ll present some details about Java Arrays and ArrayLists. So conceptually, an array in Java is the container object that we put values in. It has a fixed length, a fixed number of elements that can be put into the container, and they must be of a single type. If you create an array for integers, then you can&#39;t put strings in it. When the array is created, the length or size of the array is fixed. If you allocate an array for 100 integers, you can&#39;t later resize it to hold 101. What the container can hold can be primitive types or objects, whatever you decide when it&#39;s declared. An array has elements which we access using an index, a number starting from 0. So the first array element is that index 0 and the last element is that length minus 1.</p>
<p>So a 10-element array has the max index of 9. So we specify the number to access the individual elements of an array, whether we want to retrieve it or change it. An ArrayList is a special type of array container object. It&#39;s implemented as a class in what Java calls its collection&#39;s framework. Its size is not fixed and can grow as needed when new elements are inserted, so we say the size is dynamic. However, it can only hold object types and not primitives, although we can use the java.lang packages that wrap the primitive objects into a corresponding class. For example, the integer class wraps the primitive int type, but we can&#39;t create an ArrayList with the primitive type directly. What are some similarities between Java Arrays and ArrayLists? Well, they&#39;re both used to store elements, so they can both act as containers for holding them.</p>
<p>Arrays and ArrayLists can both store null values for objects, and they can both store duplicate values. Some containers are built to store unique values like the Java set class, but Arrays and ArrayLists can have duplicate elements. And the element order is not maintained. Arrays and ArrayLists don&#39;t hold a particular sorting, nor can they perform stack or queue based insertion and removal, such as first in last out or first in first out ordering. What about the differences between Array and ArrayLists? Well, an array is the dynamically-created object in a contiguous memory location. Its size is fixed and static in size throughout the life of the array. It&#39;s set when it&#39;s created and it must stay that way.</p>
<p>So the size is established when it&#39;s declared and it stays that way throughout the life of the array. And it stores both objects and primitives. Whereas the ArrayList is a class in the collection&#39;s framework, so it&#39;s a special type of class with the dynamic size. So you can start with a particular size or a particular number of elements that the ArrayList can hold and the ArrayList will grow to accommodate. The size is not necessary at declaration, so you don&#39;t need to specify an initial size at all. And the ArrayList will grow as necessary, based on what it&#39;s initialized to, and what elements are inserted into it. But it only stores objects. So I can&#39;t have the primitive types, I can&#39;t have a primitive int or boolean, or double, it has to be parameterized with the class. And that concludes this presentation on Java Arrays and ArrayLists.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_2" /><h2 class="section_title">3.

Your host for this session is Steve Scott.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this video, I&#39;m going to talk about Java Arrays, going to describe them and how they&#39;re used within Java. Let&#39;s first look at Array declaration and creation. So to declare an Array of integers, we specify the Array with an open and close bracket along with the type. So I have int, an open and close square bracket, and then the name of the Array, the variable name, in this case, myArray. So this declares the Array. Now to create it, creating an integer array, an int array, we have myArray &#61; new int and then in square brackets, we specify the size. And this one&#39;s created to hold 10 elements, 10 primitive integers or 10 ints. Then for the life of the array, it cannot be resized and the size is fixed from this point on.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at how we initialize an array. So to initialize the myArray, we declared in the previous slide, we can set the individual values based on the array index. So I have myArray[0] so I say index then 0 &#61; 21. So we&#39;re setting it to the int 21 myArray at index [1] &#61; 22, myArray of index [2] &#61; 23, and so on until we get to myArray of 9 which is equal to 30. So this is one way to do it. We can also create and initialize in one statement. So I have Int[] myArray &#61; then we have an open brace. Inside of it, we specify a list of ints, so I have 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and then the next line, I have 26 comma delimited up to 30. And then I close the brace and close the semi colon. What this does is create an array with the size big enough to hold all of the initializers.</p>
<p>So all of the numbers, in this case the 10 numbers from 21 to 30, so it will be as int of size 10. So we can either declare and create it like we did on the previous slide, set all of the elements individually or we can create and initialize in one statement if we know some additional values. How do we access the array elements? So as we did on the previous slide, to set the array elements, to access them, we specify the array name with the index and square brackets. But we do it without the assignment. So in this example, I have System.out.println. of the literal string, I have Element 1 at index 0: and then a space, then &#43;, so I concatenated myArray at 0. So this will take the value at 0 and put it into this print statement.</p>
<p>We&#39;d like to access the second element at index 1. We specify myArray, and 1 in square brackets, and so on. And we can do this all the way up to index [9] because it&#39;s an array of size 10. So Element 10 is the last one and the index for this element is index [9], because we started 0, so myArray of index 9. Arrays are very convenient for looping, especially using the for and for-each loop constructs in Java. So with the for loop, we use the length property of the array. So to get the size of the array, we call .length on the array variable. So to print all elements in myArray, I have 4 and then in parentheses, I have int i &#61; 0, so that&#39;s our index value or index variable; i&lt;myArray.length. So while the i variable, the index variable, is less than the array length then; i&#43;&#43;.</p>
<p>So in each iteration of the for loop, we increment the i variable which is going to be our index. And we call System.out.println of myArray at index i. So I will go from 0 to 9 and then exit the loop. We could also use the for each syntax, which simplifies it. If we&#39;d like to print all of the elements in myArray, we can use for, and then in parentheses, int i: myArray. So this is the Java for each syntax. And the int i in this case is not the index but the current value depending on the iteration of the loop. So it will start at the first element and take its value and call System.out.println of the value i and that will print the same thing. So both of these loops print the same values.</p>
<p>So Arrays are primitive containers in Java. They don&#39;t have the same functionality or capabilities as ArrayLists or other collection classes. However, there are utility methods to work with them. So we have some Array manipulation methods provided by Java. And these methods are in the java.util.Arrays class. There&#39;s methods for searching, sorting, and copying elements as well as methods for comparing if two Arrays are equal. So the java.util.Arrays class is the helper class for working with standard Java Arrays and that concludes this presentation on Java Arrays.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_3" /><h2 class="section_title">4.

This means you’ll create an array called ages of type int, with three elements initialized to 39, 27, and 97. The double brackets after the int say you’re declaring an array.</p></div><h3 class="list_title">Objectives</h3><ul class="list"><li class="list_item">demonstrate how Arrays are used within Java</li></ul><div class="section inner"><div class="section_text">[Video description begins] <em>Topic title: Programming Java Arrays. Your host for this session is Steve Scott.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this video, I&#39;ll demonstrate the standard array syntax used within Java. So we&#39;ll start in this video inside of the typical main function that&#39;s declared public static void main(String [] args) as its parameter inside of my public class main. Now on this first line inside of the function on line 6, I have int [] ages &#61; { 39, 27, 97 } ;. So what this says is to create an array called ages of type int, with three elements initialized to 39, 27 and 97. The double brackets after the int says that we&#39;re declaring an array. Now there&#39;s a separate syntax that&#39;s also valid is to take the double brackets and put it after ages. So if you&#39;ve come from C or C&#43;&#43;, this syntax might look familiar to you, as the array syntax in Java follows a similar syntax. But it&#39;s also recommended in Java that the double brackets be attached to the type before the variable name.</p>
<p>So the preferred way is int [], so open and close square brackets followed by the variable name. So we have an array ages at the moment with three elements 39, 27 and 97. Then on line 7, I extract an element from the array and save it into a variable. So I&#39;ve int myAge &#61; ages[0];, So whatever is in the square brackets is the array index. And it&#39;s important to note that arrays are indexed from 0. So the first element to access it in the array is the element 0. In this case, it should set my age to be 39. On the next line I have int yourAge &#61; ages[1];. So in this case that would be the 27. So yourAge will be set to 27.</p>
<p>And then on lines 10, 11 and 12, I print some of the results so we can verify it at this point. So when we run the program, we&#39;ll be able to look at this. So I print my ages is with the variable myAge, yourAge is and then I concatenate your age. And then I print My friend&#39;s age is ages at index 2. And then what about ages at index 3? Well, in this case if I save it and leave that in there where I referenced ages at index 3, so this will be the fourth item in the array, which doesn&#39;t exist and will be past the end of the array.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 10 reads as: system.out.println(&#34;My age is: &#34; &#43;myAge);. Line 11 reads as: system.out.println(&#34;Your age is: &#34; &#43;yourAge);. Line 12 reads as: system.out.println(&#34;My friend&#39;s age is: &#34; &#43;ages[2]);. Line 13 reads as: system.out.println(&#34;What about[3]: &#34; &#43;ages[3]);.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />So I&#39;ll leave that line in, line 13 in for the first time I run it. And the program will fail at this point. So you Shift&#43;F10 to run it at this point before I explain the rest of the code and we can see that there&#39;s this exception in the thread, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.</p>
<p>So we&#39;ve gone out of bounds. So I&#39;ll comment that line out on line 13 so we don&#39;t have that problem. Then the next part of the code on line 15, String [] names &#61; the initializer list, so the values, the string surrounded in braces with Steve, Mary, William, Bob. And on line 17, I set names[2] &#61; &#34;Bill&#34;;. So we change William to the shortened Bill. And to verify that I use System.out.println(&#34;names[2]: &#34; &#43; names[2]); So we look inside the array and we make sure it&#39;s set to Bill. We can also loop over all of the elements in an array, and one of the easier ways of doing so is using a for loop. So the conventional for loop, on line 23 I have for, and then in parentheses I initialize a loop variable and index variable int i&#61;0 followed by ; i &amp;lt; names.length.</p>
<p>So .length is a property of arrays that we can access that will give us the size of the array. And, so &amp;&amp; i &amp; &lt; ages.length. Now if we just look at names.length, that has four elements. But ages has three elements. So if we continue looping without checking both arrays, then we could go past the end of the array and we&#39;ll get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. So this will ensure that it stops after the smaller of the two arrays, in this case, ages. And then another ; i &#43;&#43; and then I have the body of the loop, which is enclosed in braces which I print System.out .println(names [i] &#43; &#34; : &#34; &#43; ages[i]); So we&#39;ll associate the name with the age and print the results.</p>
<p>There&#39;s another syntax, or a for loop, called a for-each loop, which I demonstrated on line 28. So if we don&#39;t need the index variable, and we just want to access the elements in the array, we can use the for syntax with the for loop and in parentheses, we have int age, so we actually have the value variable, : and then the array, in this case ages. Then on each iteration of the loop, it will have the current element in the variable age. And then inside this loop I do System.out.println of age. So, now I&#39;ll run the code with Shift&#43;F10 and let&#39;s have a look at the results. So, I have My age is: 39, Your age is: 27, My friend&#39;s age is: 97, names[2]: Bill. The for loop produces Steve : 39, Mary : 27 and Bill : 97. And the for-each prints the contents of the ages array 39, 27 and 97 as expected and that concludes this demonstration of programming Java arrays.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_4" /><h2 class="section_title">5.

<p>In this video, I&#39;ll present some of the important details to keep in mind about ArrayLists and how they&#39;re used within Java. ArrayLists are created to hold a single type of element. We say that the ArrayList is parameterized to hold a type of object. And it&#39;s only object types and not primitive types, at least not directly though we can use a wrapper class for a primitive type in case we need to use them as our elements. So for example, if we need an integer, instead of using the primitive int, we can use the integer class to parameterize the ArrayList. ArrayLists are also resizeable. They can grow as needed as more elements are inserted. What are some of the features of ArrayList? Well, they&#39;re part of the java.util package, and we import java.util.ArrayList to include them.</p>
<p>They can be slower than regular arrays, but mostly due to their added functionality. ArrayList is the necessity when you need an array that can be resized to fit more elements, whereas the conventional array in Java is fixed. ArrayLists are useful when array manipulation is necessary, because of the capabilities and characteristics of the ArrayList class. What are some of the common ArrayList capabilities and characteristics? Well, they support retrieval by index using the get method. It supports boxed types, so converting primitive types to the wrapper classes of the ArrayList with Java&#39;s auto boxing and unboxing functionality to automatically perform the conversions to the parameterized type. Say from int to the integer class or vice versa. It permits duplicate and null entries, and it maintains the order of the elements. So if you traverse the ArrayList one element at a time, add another element and it&#39;s not going to change the order of anything in it.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not implemented with any type of tree structure under the hood. It only maintains continuous arrays internally. However, it doesn&#39;t support primitive types, so no basic primitive int, or char, or Boolean, or double, or short, or any other primitive types in Java. It is not synchronized for multi threaded use. So if you have an ArrayList and multiple threads can modify it, then you need to handle the synchronization at the thread level outside of the ArrayList. How are ArrayLists declared and created? Well, we import the ArrayList class using import java.util.ArrayList. We declare the ArrayList of integers by using ArrayList and then in angle brackets, the integer parameter. So we say ArrayList parameterized by integer myArrayList, the name of the ArrayList. And then we can create integer ArrayList using myArrayList &#61; new ArrayList, with Integer in angle brackets, and then in parentheses an initial size, in this case 5.</p>
<p>That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s fixed or that&#39;s the maximum size, just the initial size. So when it reaches 5, it will increase the size of the ArrayList. So when using ArrayList, we can initialize it by using the add method. So myArrayList.add(1); myArrayList.add(2); myArrayList.add(3); and so on until we get to the last element. So if we have 5 elements we want to add, we can stop there, but we can also populate it with a loop. So in this example, for int i &#61; 1 while i is less than or equal to 5; i&#43;&#43;). And in that loop, we call myArrayList.add with i and it will perform the same thing as inserting them individually. Now to access array elements, we can&#39;t use the double bracket syntax like we do with arrays, we have to use the get member function.</p>
<p>So we have this method that retrieves based on an index value. So in this first part, I have System.out.printIn with the string Element 1 at index 0 and I concatenate myArrayList.get(0) so it gets the first element. And just like regular arrays, their indexed starting from 0, so the first element is at 0, and the last element is at the size of the array list minus 1. And to get the next element, Element 2 is at index 1, Element 3 is at index 2, and Element 4 is at index 3, and so on until we get to the last element, Element 5. What about modifying ArrayList elements? Again, we can&#39;t use the square bracket syntax like we do with the array, so we have a method set. So myArrayList.set element 0, so index 0, then we set its value to 10, so 0, 10, as the arguments to the set function. So set takes two arguments, the first one the index, and the second one the value.</p>
<p>We can delete an element by specifying in index. So myArrayList.remove(0); so this removes the element at index 0 from the ArrayList. We can clear the entire ArrayList, all of its contents, by calling myArrayList.clear. And we can get the number of elements, the total number of elements, in the ArrayList by calling myArrayList.size and that concludes this presentation on Java ArrayList.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_5" /><h2 class="section_title">6.

<p>In this video, I&#39;ll demonstrate how ArrayLists are used within Java. So ArrayLists are a resizeable array implementation. This provides us with features we don&#39;t get in a conventional array. So in this example on line 1, I declared to be in the package com.example, then I import the required classes. I import java.util.ArrayList, then import java.util.Arrays, import java.util.Collections, and import java.util.List. Then I declare my class public class Main with public static void main with String[] args as its parameter, the main entry point into our program. So on line 11, our code begins. I declare a conventional array int[] nums &#61; the initializer list, so the list of numbers in braces with 5, 43, 99, 27, -50, 100022, -75, 0, 1, 7, 5, then 774. So I&#39;m going to take this array of ints and convert it to an ArrayList of integers.</p>
<p>So we&#39;re going from the primitive int type to the integer object type. On line 13, I declare a List of type Integer called numContainer &#61; new ArrayList &lt;&gt; because the type has been defined. And we pass to the constructor as the initial size, nums.length. So to get the elements from our primitive int array into our container, we need to loop over the elements and add them to the container. So on line 14, I have a for each loop for and then in parentheses, int num : nums and then inside the loop, numContainer.add(num). So this ArrayList has an add method that will add the numbers one by one again. And then when we exit the loop, all of the numbers from int[] nums will be in numContainer. So on line 17, I would put the contents of numContainer with System.out.println with numContainer: space and then I concatenate numContainer.</p>
<p>So numContainer has a two-string method which will take all of the elements in the list and display them when we output them. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 reads as: system.out.println(&#34;numContainer:&#34; &#43; numContainer);. Line 18 reads as: Collections.sort(numContainer);.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Now if I tried to do this with nums, it wouldn&#39;t work. We can&#39;t take a conventional array and try and output the contents in this way, so numContainer gives us that feature. We can also use the collections utility to sort our ArrayList. So to put it in sorted order, on line 18, I have Collections.sort, and I just pass in numContainer and it will sort it. I create a second int array. So what I&#39;m doing is taking the ArrayList, sorting it, converting it back to an array events. On line 20, I have int[] sortedInts, so this is the name of our array, &#61; new int, and the size is going to be numContainer.size. Our ArrayList has a size method to return the number of elements.</p>
<p>On line 21, I have a for loop, a conventional for loop with for int i &#61; 0, while i is less than sortedInts.length i&#43;&#43;, and then sortedInts[i] &#61; numContainer.get of index i. So in a conventional array, we use the bracketed notation to index the array, and in the ArrayList, we use the get function. And then on line 25, I have System.out.println returnedInts. So this is what returns into our sorted array &#43; Arrays.toString of sortedInts. So we can use Arrays.toString of conventional array to return the elements in a string that we can display. So you&#39;ll Shift&#43;F10 to run the code. And in the results, we get numContainer with all of the elements in the original order, and then the returnedInts in the sorted order, from -75, all the way up to 100022 as the largest element at the end and that concludes this demonstration of programming with Java ArrayList.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_6" /><h2 class="section_title">7.

<p>In this video, I&#39;ll describe the iterator interface and how it&#39;s used within Java collection classes. So the Java iterator interface is part of the collection framework in Java. It&#39;s used to retrieve elements and step over them or traverse them. There are three iterator types. The enumeration, the iterator, and list iterator are the main interfaces. However, the enumeration is now considered a legacy method. And nowadays, we typically only use iterator or list iterator interfaces for iterating over collections. So what are the iterator methods? The first is the hasNext method, which returns a Boolean saying whether or not there&#39;s another item in the collection that the iterator can point to. The next method returns the next object, a reference to it. If there is none, it returns the no such element exception.</p>
<p>And where hasNext returns false, you could expect this exception to be thrown if you call next. The iterator also has the remove function to remove an element from the collection. This is something that the legacy enumeration interface did not have. The list iterator is a two-way navigation of lists. It provides next element and a previous element. So it provides for bidirectional traversal. It also permits modifying elements like the iterator that it derives from. So what does this look like in terms of declaration and creation of iterators? Well, first we have to import the iterator class with import java.util.Iterator. We declare an Iterator by parameterizing it with a type, so Iterator and in &lt;String&gt; the type of iterator the elements that it&#39;s going to iterate over, in this case called myIterator.</p>
<p>So this will be an Iterator to iterate over the contents of a string. And we can create an Iterator from an array my list. So myIterator &#61; myArrayList.iterator(); And how do we use the iterator? How do we get an item from an array using an Iterator? myIterator.next will return the item from the array or list. We can use the hasNext method to loop through an array. So while (myIterator.hasNext()) {System.out.println(myIterator.next()) inside the body of our while loop. So the Iterator maintains a current position, and every time next is called it, advances that position. Let&#39;s look at the ListIterator Declaration and Creation. So to import it, we import java.util.ListIterator. So when we declare a ListIterator, make sure that the ListIterator, the L in List, and the I in Iterator, are in uppercase.</p>
<p>So ListIterator called myIterator we can create, so myIterator &#61; myArrayList.listIterator(); So the member method returned by myArrayList uses a lowercase l. So list with a lowercase l and then iterator with the uppercase I. We can get the first item or next item by calling myIterator.next(); We get the previous item and go backwards with myIterator.previous. Then we can loop through an array in reverse, using the previous method, while(myIterator.hasPrevious()). So is there a previous item? And if so, System.out.println(myIterator.previous()) and that concludes this presentation on Java iterators.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_7" /><h2 class="section_title">8.

<p>In this video, I&#39;ll describe the LinkedList class and how it&#39;s used within Java. So the LinkedList class is similar to ArrayList on the surface. However, under the hood, inside the implementation of LinkedList it looks very different. And is used for different types of problems or programming design patterns. Its performance is very different than the ArrayList. LinkedList contains objects of the same type. So it&#39;s parameterized by a particular type of object and does have some of the same methods as ArrayList. What are some of LinkedList&#39;s features? Well, it&#39;s easy to add and remove elements to the front or to the back of the list, as well as remove them. Elements are stored as separate objects and they&#39;re not stored in contiguous blocks, like in the ArrayList.</p>
<p>Elements in a LinkedList are linked by pointers and addresses. So a LinkedList you can think of it as a chain of elements with each link pointing to the next in line. And elements in a LinkedList are referred to as nodes, like they would be in a graph. What are some of the common LinkedList methods? Well, there&#39;s addFirst() to put to the front of the list. addLast() to put at the end. removeFirst() to remove the first element. And removeLast() to remove the last element. As well as getFirst() to look at the first element but not remove it. And the same with getLast() to retrieve the last element. But getLast() is also a non-destructive operation. How do we declare LinkedList and create one?</p>
<p>Well to import it we need to import java.util.LinkedList. We declare it using LinkedList followed by a type. So the type of the node in this case, integer, we parameterize it by integer inside of angle brackets, and then give it a name, myLinkedList. We can create the LinkedList with the new keyword using MyLinkedList &#61; new LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt;(). How do we use the LinkedList? Well, we can add an item by calling myLinkedList.add with the element as an argument. In this case, the number 5, which gets stored as an integer object. We can get the first element by calling myLinkedList.getFirst. In this case, it would return 5 and get the last element. Well, if there&#39;s only one element, myLinkedList.getLast() will return 5 as well.</p>
<p>So getFirst() and getLast() point to the same element if there&#39;s only one item in the LinkedList. We can loop over the elements using hasNext to loop through the LinkedList. We can create an iterator, so I have iterator parameterized by integer, the same object type as in myLinkedList and I call this iterator i and I set it equal to myLinkedList.iterator. So myLinkedList.iterator returns the iterator and we can loop using while(i.hasNext). And then inside of the loop I print using System.out.println(i.next), and I close the loop. And that loop will print all the elements and if there&#39;s one, it will only print the one and then exit. hasNext will return false which quits out of the while loop. How do we modify LinkedList elements? So I&#39;ll add 20 to the beginning calling myLlinkedList.addFirst(20). So it prepends an element to the front of the list that adds a node for it.</p>
<p>We can add 20 at the end by calling addLast. And we can remove the first element by calling myLinkedList.removeFirst or remove the last element by calling myLinkedList.removeLast. So the LinkedList class can behave as a stack or a queue with many of the same operations that can be thought of as pushing or popping elements to the front or back of the list. And that concludes this presentation on Java LinkedList.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_8" /><h2 class="section_title">9.

<p>In this video, I&#39;ll demonstrate how the LinkedList class is used within Java. I have a file here, Main.java, which is in the package com.example. And I have an import, java.util.LinkedList. So this is a member of the Java collections framework. It&#39;s a type of collection or container of elements that can be used as the type of stack, list, or queue data structure. Internally, it&#39;s implemented as a doubly linked list, one with forward and backward iterators. So inside of my class Main, inside of the main function on line 8, I start with LinkedList parameterized by String called books &#61; new LinkedList with double angle brackets and double parentheses to call the default constructor. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 7 reads as: public static void main(String[] args) {. Line 8 reads as: LinkedList&lt;String&gt; books &#61; new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />So LinkedList will resize itself internally as necessary. And another point is it&#39;s not synchronized internally for multi-threaded use.</p>
<p>So you need to synchronize it externally if you have multiple threads trying to update a single linked list. On line 10, I add my first element. So for this I use books.push and pass the string Ulysses. Then on line 11, books.push, War and Peace. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 10 reads as: books.push(e: &#34;ULysses&#34;);. Line 11 reads as: books.push(e: &#34;War and Peace&#34;);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />On line 12, I call System.out.println with this string Peek:&#43; books.peek. So I call the peek method to see what the current element is. So this we could think of as the element on top of the linked list if we think of it in terms of a stack, or a list, or a queue. If we&#39;re going to be putting elements on using a push and taking them off using a pop, then we can think of a linked list as a stack. On line 13 I print, After peek: &#43; books. So the peek operation is a nondestructive operation, it just looks at the element, doesn&#39;t actually take it off. If we want to take the top element off and return it, we call the pop method.</p>
<p>On line 15, I print Pop with books.pop. So the item popped out of the linked list will be printed, and then after the pop operation, I print the contents of books.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 15 reads as: System.out.println(&#34;Pop: &#34; &#43; books.pop());. Line16 reads as: System.out.println(&#34;After pop: &#34; &#43; books);.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Then on line 18, I call books.pop() and it just removes the element. And at that point, since I put two books on the linked list and pull two books off, it should be empty. So I print, Empty after another pop, &#43; books.isEmpty(). It returns true if the LinkedList collection is empty. Now I create an array of books book names, so String[] bookNames. So I&#39;m creating a conventional string array called bookNames and I initialize it. So inside of the braces I have &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;, &#34;A Tale of Two Cities&#34;, &#34;The Iliad&#34;, &#34;The Republic&#34;, &#34;Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland&#34;. So I have these five book names.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to loop over them using a for each loop. So for(String name : bookNames) books.push (name). So it&#39; going to take them individually and put them into our LinkedList.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 24 reads as: for String name : bookNames) {. Line 25 reads as: books.push(name);. Line 26 reads as: }.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Then I print, After loop to push array elements onto LinkedList. I use println to print books. Then I print books.peek, books.size, books.peekFirst, and books.peekLast. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 27 reads as: System.out.println(&#34;After loop to push array elements onto the LinkedList: &#34;);. Line 28 reads as: System.out.println(books);. Line 29 reads as: System.out.println(&#34;Peek: &#34; &#43; books.peek());. Line 30 reads as: System.out.println(&#34;Size: &#34; &#43; books.size());. Line 31 reads as: System.out.println(&#34;First element: &#34; &#43; books.peekFirst());. Line 32 reads as: System.out.println(&#34;Last element: &#34; &#43; books.peekLast());.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />So the peek functions have some certain behavior and because it&#39;s a doubly LinkedList, we can get the first element or the last element. And then on line 35, the last operation is an operation you shouldn&#39;t do. If you need to index elements in a LinkedList, you&#39;re probably using the wrong collection and you should use an array list or some other type of list. So this is a slow operation, where I print System.out.println(&#34;Get element 3: &#34; &#43; books.get(3)).</p>
<p>So if you need to get items from the front of the list or the back of the list, or insert to the front or to the beginning, then a LinkedList is fine. But if you need to index it quickly, then it&#39;s not the data structure to use. Now I&#39;ll do Shift&#43;F10 to run the code. And at the beginning, when we call our peek method, after we&#39;ve pushed Ulysses and War and Peace into the list, the top item is War and Peace. So that&#39;s what we get when we return. And then after the peek operation, the two books are still there. We get War and Peace and Ulysses. And we pop War and Peace. And then after the pop operation we&#39;re left with Ulysses. Then we call books.pop by itself on line 18 and, Empty after another pop, that equals true at this point. Then after the loop to push array elements onto the list, when we print the list at that point we have all of the names.</p>
<p>Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland, The Republic, The Iliad, A Tale of Two Cities, and Pride and Prejudice. So these five books, they&#39;re in the reverse order of what they were on line 21 when they were initialized in the array bookNames. So the LinkedList will put them on from back to front. And then if we peek, Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland is at the top. The size is 5, so there&#39;s five elements. So the first element is Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland. The last element is Pride and Prejudice. And the element at index 3 is A Tale of Two Cities. If we look at the output, Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland, The Republic, The Iliad, A Tale of Two Cities comes at index 3 counting up from 0. And that concludes this demonstration of programming with Java&#39;s LinkedList.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_9" /><h2 class="section_title">10.

<p>This video, I&#39;ll describe Java&#39;s HashMap class. So a HashMap stores elements in key/value pairs like an associative array, where the key uniquely identifies the value. So instead of a numeric index, the key could be unique object, and oftentimes we use a string so we have name that indexes the value. So objects are accessible by an index defined by the key. And the reason why it&#39;s called a HashMap is that the key is hashed or digest is created to help find the value. So there&#39;s no searching for the value. We just compute the key that points to the particular value. So how does the Java HashMap reference the value? So the object key is an index, and that object corresponds to another object called the value. And the key and value could be different types.</p>
<p>So we need to parameterize the HashMap to define the type of key and the type of value. So to declare a HashMap, we first need to import the HashMap class using import java.util.HashMap then we declare it using HashMap and then in angle brackets, we need to specify the two types. First, the key in this case is String, Integer. So it&#39;s going to use the String key to get the value which will be an Integer type, and I call this myHashMap. To create the HashMap, we could use myHashMap &#61; new HashMap with the parameters String, Integer, followed by the open and close parentheses. Using a HashMap, we could add an item using the put method. So myHashMap.put with the first argument the key in this case, (&#34;Oranges&#34;, 50); where 50 is the integer value.</p>
<p>To access a HashMap, we use the get method, so myHashMap.get with the argument being the key. So Oranges in this case would return 50. How do we determine if a HashMap contains a specific value and return the key value? We could use if (myHashMap.containsKey (&#34;Oranges&#34;)). So in this case, it could look up the key to see if it exists. And if it does, it says Integer i &#61; myHashMap.get (&#34;Oranges&#34;); and then prints using System.out.println(&#34;key value&#34; &#43; &#34;Oranges:&#34; &#43; i); returns the number. How do we modify elements in a HashMap? Well, we can remove a specific element by calling myHashMap.remove and providing the key. We can clear the HashMap using myHashMap.clear(); and get the number of elements by calling myHashMap.size();.</p>
<p>How do we get HashMap keys and values using a loop? Well, we can get all the keys for the HashMap, and put it in a for each loop using for (String i : myHashMap.keySet()). So the keySet returns a set view to the keys in the map. Now one thing about HashMap, there&#39;s no specific order that this will be returned in. And inside the loop, I print System.out.println(i); so it will print the string element. But there&#39;s no guarantee each time I insert a new element into the HashMap, a new pair, that it will be put in any particular location. The location is based on the hash value or the hash digest value of the key so that it can look up the value with the constant time. So it&#39;s built for speed so that it doesn&#39;t have to search for elements, doesn&#39;t have to search for keys to find the value. It can look it up in constant running time instead of having to search through the elements to find what it&#39;s looking for.</p>
<p>We can get all of the values in the HashMap by using the values function. So for (Integer i : myHashMap.values()). And inside the loop, I call System.out.println(i);. Now one thing to keep in mind with HashMaps is that the keys are unique. So if you try to insert a key that already exists, it will overwrite the existing key. And that concludes this presentation on Java&#39;s HashMap.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_10" /><h2 class="section_title">11.

Your host for this session is Steve Scott.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this video, I&#39;ll demonstrate how a HashMap class is used within Java. So HashMap is an associative array type of data structure. It allows the constant time key base insertion and retrieval of elements. However, the order of the elements is not guaranteed and does not stay constant over time. So if you need elements in a particular order, such as the order they were inserted or sorted in some way, then HashMap is not the right choice. But the basic put and get operations are what HashMap excels at. So in this Main.java, I have package com.example to which it belongs and import java.util.HashMap;. So HashMap is a collection in the java.util package. I declare public class Main and then, a private static final int MAP_CAPACITY &#61; 10; which gives me a nice constant value to set the initial size of the HashMap.</p>
<p>Then in my main function on line 10, I have HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;. So the first parameterized value or type is String, which says the key is a String type, String as the value type. So we have name value pairs that take a String and return a String. We have emailUsername &#61; new HashMap&lt;&gt;(MAP_CAPACITY); to set its initial capacity through the constructor. Then on line 11, emailUsername.put so I call the put method to add a pair to the HashMap with the key being steve&#64;example.com, so the email then comma steve456 a username. So if we need to retrieve someone&#39;s username based on their email, we can call get on the HashMap with the email address and it returns the associated username.</p>
<p>On line 12, I put another username with <a href="mailto:bob&#64;site.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bob&#64;site.co</a>.uk, bob1962, then email username.put alice&#64;somewhere.ca, havingfun55. Then on line 15, System.out.println Size, so to retrieve the number of elements inside of the HashMap, we call the size method, so emailUsername.size. And then on line 16, I print the Username associated with steve&#64;example.com, so I call emailUsername.get (&#34;steve&#64;example.com&#34;));.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 15 reads as: System.out.println(&#34;Size: &#34; &#43; emailUsername.size());. Line 16 reads as: System.out.println(&#34;Username associated with steve&#64;example.com:&#34; &#43; emailUsername.get(&#34;steve&#64;example.com&#34;));</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Now what happens if we try an email that doesn&#39;t exist? Now this won&#39;t generate an exception, what it&#39;s going to do is print null. So system.out.println(&#34;Try a non-existent email: &#34; &#43; emailUsername.get &#34;nobody&#64;example.com&#34;)); as the string we pass to it. So it&#39;s going to look for this key, it&#39;s not going to find it and it&#39;s going to return null. We can also delete by the key. I can call it emailUsername.remove( o: &#34;bob&#64;site.co.uk&#34;); and this will remove the entry associated with this email address.</p>
<p>And at this point, if I call Size it will return a size of two, because we put three in, we removed one and we&#39;re left with two. We could also replace an entry. If I call it emailUsername.put with a key that already exists in the HashMap, then it will replace it. In this case, I&#39;ll replace it with steve123. We can also loop over all of the keys, although it won&#39;t give us results in any particular order. So there&#39;s no guaranteed order in how they&#39;re retrieved but it will return them all. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 26 reads as: emailusername.put(k: &#34;steve&#64;example.com&#34;, v: &#34;steve123&#34;);.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />So I have a for each loop with for(String email : emailUsername.keySet());. So this returns all of the keys, and on each iteration of the loop, it stores the key value in email. So System.out.println(email &#43; &#34; : &#34; &#43; emailUsername.get(email));.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 29 reads as: for (String email : emailUsername.keySet()) {. Line 30 reads as: System.out.println(email &#43; &#34;: &#34; &#43; emailUsername.get(email));. Line 31 reads as: }.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>We can also loop over all the values, but we can&#39;t get the key based on the value so it doesn&#39;t work in reverse. But we can extract just the values and print them using a for each loop as well, so for (String userName : emailUsername.values()). So the values method returns all of the values, and we loop over them, calling System.out.println(userName);. I&#39;ll use Shift&#43;F10 to run the code and we&#39;ll have a look at the results. So in the results, the first output is the size. So the size after I&#39;ve put 3 elements in, which returns 3. The username associated with steve&#64;example.com at this point in the code from line 16 is steve456. The non-existent email returns null. After I&#39;ve removed bob&#64;site.co.uk we&#39;re left with 2 elements in the HashMap.</p>
<p>And when I loop over using the key set that was from line 29, I have alice&#64;somewhere.ca : havingfun55 and steve&#64;example.com : steve123 which we changed on line 26 by calling the put function with steve&#64;example.com and giving it a new value. And the values from the final loop give us havingfun55 and steve123. And that concludes this demonstration of programming with Java&#39;s HashMap.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_11" /><h2 class="section_title">12.

<p>In this video, I&#39;ll describe Java&#39;s HashSet Class. So the HashSet is a collection of elements. So it&#39;s a container that contains unique elements of a particular type, that&#39;s parameterized when we create the object. Duplicate elements are not permitted in a HashSet, so it&#39;s a unique collection of elements. If you try to add something that already exists, nothing happens. And this includes a null element, and although null is allowed, only one is allowed inside of your HashSet. It also implements the Set interface, which is also a member of the Java collections framework. What are some features of the HashSet? Well, elements are not ordered. The HashSet makes it performant in adding, removing, and checking to see if elements exist in the set, but not for their order.</p>
<p>So this is not for an ordered set of elements. It allows null, but only one. And it has consistent performance for operations. So the runtime in big O notation would be O of one for operations to test the existence to insert and remove elements from the HashSet. So how do we declare and create a HashSet? Well, we need to import the HashSet class from Java.util.HashSet. We declare with HashSet and the parameter in angle brackets, in this case, a HashSet of strings called myHashSet. And we create the HashSet with myHashSet &#61; new HashSet&lt;String&gt;(); where we can specify an initial capacity if we wish. How do we use the HashSet? Well, to add an item, we call the Add method. So myHashSet.add(&#34;Oranges&#34;); adds Oranges to the HashSet as an element.</p>
<p>We can loop through the HashSet but not in any particular order. And there&#39;s no guarantee after removing or adding another element that the items will stay in the same order. I can loop using Java&#39;s for each syntax with for(String i : myHashSet). Then inside the body of the loop, I call System.out.println to print the element i and then I close the loop. We can modify elements. We can remove an element, myHashSet.remove(&#34;Oranges&#34;);. And we can clear the HashSet or empty it out, calling the clear method myHashSet.clear(). And we can get the current number of elements by calling size, for example myHashSet.size().</p>
<p>How do we test for the existence of an element to see if the HashSet contains the element? Well, we call the contains method. For example, if(myHashSet.contains(&#34;Oranges&#34;)){ System.out.println &#34;(Found oranges&#34;);} So calling the contains function returns the true or false, telling us whether the element exists. And that concludes this presentation on Java&#39;s HashSet.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_12" /><h2 class="section_title">13.

<p>In this video, I&#39;ll demonstrate how the HashSet class is used in Java. So the HashSet provides for fast insertion and removal and it&#39;s fast to check the existence of an element in the set. And it&#39;s fast to check the size of the set at any given time. However, it&#39;s not an appropriate container for ordering nor traversing in a particular order. So if you need an array of things or a container of things that&#39;s sorted, a HashSet is not what you want to use. So we start in this Main.java file by including this in package com.example, then I import Java.util.HashSet;. And then in my public class main inside of the main function, the entry point into the application on line 8, I have HashSet&lt;String&gt; names &#61; new HashSet&lt;&gt;(); to call the constructor.</p>
<p>Now that it&#39;s created, I can add elements, so I call names.add(&#34;Steve&#34;); then I do the same for the string, Mallory, Alice, Jane, and the empty string. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 10 reads as: names.add(&#34;Steve&#34;);. Line 11 reads as: names.add(&#34;Mallory&#34;);. Line 12 reads as: names.add(&#34;Alice&#34;);. Line 13 reads as: names.add(&#34;Jane&#34;);. Line 14 reads as: names.add(&#34;&#34;);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Then in line 16, I call System.out.println(&#34; &#39;names&#39; has &#34; &#43; names.size() &#43; &#34;elements. &#34;); so the size() returns number of elements And then what happens if we try to add an element to a HashSet that already exists? So System.out.println(&#34;Add &#39;Steve&#39; again.&#34;); so names.add(&#34;Steve&#34;); with the same case so an uppercase S-T-E-V-E, then System.out.println(&#34;New size: &#34; &#43; names.size());. Now in this case the size will be the same because Steve already existed and it won&#39;t add duplicates of entries into the HashSet. It&#39;s also case sensitive, so if I call system.out.println to check to see if it contains steve, spelled with a lowercase s, by calling names.contains(&#34;steve&#34;).</p>
<p>So the contains function checks for the existence of an element, in this case it will return false, but if I call contains on the string Mallory, spelled correctly with the uppercase M. It should return true.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 24 reads as: System.out.println(&#34;Contains &#39;steve&#39;? &#34; &#43; names.contains(&#34;steve&#34;));. Line 25 reads as: System.out.println(&#34;Contains &#39;Mallory&#39;? &#34; &#43; names.contains(&#34;Mallory&#34;));.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Let&#39;s say I want to get rid of the empty element or the element with a empty string, I call it names.remove(o: &#34;&#34;); and it will remove it. If I want to empty out or clear the HashSet, I call names.clear(); and I can check to see if that worked by calling names.isEmpty(). So I print that result at the end.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 31 reads as: System.out.println(&#34;Is empty? &#34; &#43; names.isEmpty());.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Now I&#39;ll do SHIFT&#43;F10, and in the results, I get that names has 5 elements, I add Steve again, and its New size is 5. It&#39;s still 5 because it didn&#39;t re-add Steve, because it already existed. Then my check to see if it contains Steve spelled incorrectly with a lowercase s, it returns false, so it is case sensitive.</p>
<p>And then if it contains Mallory that returns true and then after I call clear isEmpty is true at the end. And that concludes this demonstration of programming with Java&#39;s HashSet</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_13" /><h2 class="section_title">14.
