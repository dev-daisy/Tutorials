Your host for this session is Boris Misljencevic.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this video, we&#39;ll describe what Classes are and how they&#39;re used in Java. A-Class can be thought of as a blueprint. For example, we can have a Car as a Class. In the Car, Class will be a blueprint of a Car. So we could think of the different Attributes that a Car has such as a make, model, color, and price. We could think of the different methods as such as speed up, slow down, stop, and start, and so on. So the Class defines all the Attributes and all the actions that could happen to that particular item that we&#39;re trying to describe with the Java programming language.</p>
<p>Now an Object is an instance of a Class. So a Class could have one too many instances, and each instance of a Class can be different. Because we could pass in different parameters when we&#39;re instantiating the Class and instantiating the Class gets done through a constructor. So for the Car example, we could have a Car that&#39;s a Toyota, for example. So the make would be a Toyota and the model would be a Corolla, it might be a red color, and the price might be $10,000, and we could also have another Car Object that could be a BMW X3 that could be gray and cost $30,000. So there&#39;s some examples of Objects as we mentioned, a Car is a good example of an Object and that would be an instance of the Car Class. We could also have a Class called Dog, and the Dog Class could have various Attributes such as the breed of Dog, the age, the color, and so on, and then when we instantiate that Class of Dog, we&#39;re going to have an Object of Dog and we could have various types of Dogs bypassing in different parameters when they&#39;re instantiating a Dog such as a different breed, different color, different age, and so on.</p>
<p>Another example would be an Employee. So an Employee could be a Class and we could then instantiate an Employee and we could have an Object of Employee. So examples of Attributes for the Employee Class would be first name, last name, salary, age, and so on, and then we could create various Employees within the organization based on that Class blueprint and each Employee would be its own Object. So we could pass in for example, a name of Fred, Last Name of Smith, salary of $50,000, and an age of 30 years old. So that would be an example of one Object and then we could create Objects for each Employee within the organization using that Employee Class blueprint. So Object-oriented programming is really based on Classes and Objects. So Classes have Attributes, so we were speaking about Attributes previously and basically an Attribute as we said for a Car could be the make, model, color, price, and so on. For an Employee it could be a first name, last name, email address, age, and for a Dog, as we mentioned, it could be the Dog&#39;s breed, the Dog&#39;s age, the Dog&#39;s weight and height. Now Methods in a Class are what used to actually define the actions of that Class. So a Method of a Class for example for a Car could be turned on, so we could turn the Car on, we could have a Method that increases the price of the Car or decreases the price.</p>
<p>So we&#39;re modifying the Attributes by those Methods. We could also have Methods that get and set certain Attributes which we&#39;ll cover later. So basically, we could pass in a parameter into the Method to set a value of an attribute or to get the value of an attribute, and this follows proper encapsulation. We could also have Methods, for example, in the case of an Employee to make the Employee older to increase their salary, to change their first name, change their email, and so on. So as we mentioned for the Attributes so for the Car we could have a Make, Model, Year, and Color. For the Dog, we could have the Breed, Size, Color, and Age, and for the Employee, we could have a Name, Age, Position, and Salary Attributes. So as we mentioned, for the Methods for the Car, a Car could be parked, it could be started, it could be driving. We could think of all the different states or actions that could happen to a Car and implement Methods for those would in our Car Class. For the Dog, it could be wagging his tail, it could be eating, sleeping, and so on, and we could also once again think of a comprehensive set of actions that Dogs can do and add those Methods within our Dog Class, and for an Employee, they could have different states so they could be at work, traveling, or on vacation, and once again, we could think of more things, they could be eating, they could be exercising, sleeping, and so on, and we could add all those Methods to the Employee Class.</p>
<p>So in order to create a Class, we are going to specify public, which is our access modifier space Class space fruit. So this is a Class that&#39;s defined with the public access modifier and the Class is called Fruit. We&#39;re then going to have an opening bracket and we&#39;re going to make sure that at the end of our Class, we have a closing bracket and everything contained within the Class is between the two brackets. So here we have an attribute string of fruit is equal to apples. So we&#39;re creating a new attribute or instance variable to Class are called fruit and we&#39;re setting that equal to Apple. So now to create an Object, we&#39;re going to instantiate the Class. So we have public Class fruit. We have Attributes string fruit equals apple, and then we&#39;re going to have our Main Method. So the Main Method is what Java goes into to run our programs.</p>
<p>So public static void Main. It&#39;s going to take a string array of arguments. We&#39;re not going to be passing any in, and what we&#39;re going to specify is a fruit. So we&#39;re specifying the Class name, space. The name of the Object so be called Fruit, and then upper case Obj or Fruit Object equals new. So new calls the constructor of the Class to instantiate a new Object to a new instance of the Class and Fruit, and notice that we&#39;re not passing anything in because we didn&#39;t define a constructor that takes any parameters. Now we&#39;ll go over this later in the course. But a constructor can take either no parameters or multiple parameters to set the Attributes or instance variables of the Class when that Object gets instantiated. So right now we&#39;re not passing anything in because we don&#39;t have a constructor that takes in any parameters.</p>
<p>So we just have a open bracket and close bracket. So this is going to instantiate a new Object called fruit Object, and then below that we have system.out.println, which is going to print to our console fruitObj.fruit. So we&#39;re accessing that attribute to our instance variable and we&#39;re going to get Apple and that&#39;s we see in the output, we see Apple, and once again under System.out.println, we have a closed bracket to close the Main Method, and then another close bracket to close public Class fruit. So now to create multiple Objects so in order to create multiple Objects, it&#39;s similar to creating a single Object. So we have our public Class fruit again, we have our string fruit equals apple. We have our Main Method, and then we have fruitObj1 equals new Fruit. So we&#39;re instantiating a new Object from that blueprint from that fruit Class.</p>
<p>Then we have fruitObj2 equals new Fruit. So once again, we&#39;re instantiating a new Object and that&#39;s gonna have a different memory address and it&#39;s going to be called Object two, and then we&#39;re going to print out Obj1.fruit and Obj2.fruit, and we could see they&#39;re both identical because we haven&#39;t modified that string Apple within the two Objects. So it&#39;s just going to print out that string Apple.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_2" /><h2 class="section_title">3.

<p>In this demo we&#39;re going to go over creating a new class and running it. So here I am in my Ubuntu 18.04 environment and I have IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition open. We&#39;re going to go ahead and click on File&gt;New&gt;Project. We&#39;re going to select the project SDK as Java version 1.8. Click Next. Click Next, and then we&#39;re going to pick a project location. So in my case, it&#39;ll be my home/boris directory and I&#39;ll go inside my code directory and inside my classes directory, and click OK. I&#39;m going to give my project a name of car, and then I&#39;m going to click Finish to create the project.</p>
<p>It&#39;s going to ask me if I want to open it in This Window, and I&#39;ll say yes. This Window. So here I have my template of my project in the left hand pane. I could click on the arrow and I could see my whole project structure is defined, including my external libraries. So let&#39;s create two new classes inside the source directory. We&#39;re going to right-click on the source directory, click on New&gt;Java Class. We&#39;re going to create one Class called Car and another Class that&#39;s going to be called Main. So let&#39;s start working on car. So the public class car is going to have a few instance variables which are going to define the characteristics of a Car. So we could think about the classic characteristics of a Car. So we could have a String make on line 2.</p>
<p>On line 3 we&#39;ll have a String model. On line 4 we&#39;ll have a String colour, and on line 5 we&#39;ll have an int price. We could then go ahead and create a constructor to initialize all our instance variables for our Car object. So let&#39;s create a constructor for Car, and it&#39;s going to take four arguments so it&#39;s going to take a String make, String model, String colour, and an int price. Inside our constructor we&#39;re going to initialize all our instance variables. So we&#39;re going to use the this keyword which is essentially going to refer to the instance of the object that we&#39;re speaking about. So this . make is going to refer to the make instance variable for that instance of the Car object, and we&#39;ll set this.make &#61; make, which will get passed into the constructor as a string parameter when instantiating a new Car object.</p>
<p>this.model &#61; model. this.color &#61; color, and this.price &#61; price. So that completes our constructor.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 7 reads as: public car(String make, String model, String colour, int price) {. Line 8 reads as: this.make&#61;make;. Line 9 reads as: this.model&#61;model;. Line 10 reads as: this.colour&#61;colour;. Line 11 reads as: this.price&#61;price;. Line 12 reads as: }.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Now we could create some more methods, and we could play around a little bit and see how our class comes together, and then we could test it out inside our Main.java class. So what we&#39;re going to do now is we could actually right-click and click on Generate, which is a shortcut in IntelliJ IDEA, and we could generate a toString method.</p>
<p>So we could click on toString, we&#39;re going to select all the instance variables and hit OK. That&#39;s going to override the default toString method and return a String representation of our Car with the make, model, color, and price.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 14 reads as: &#64;Override. Line 15 reads as: public String toString() {. Line 16 reads as: return &#34;Car{&#34; &#43;. Line 17 reads as: &#34;make&#61;&#39; &#34; &#43; make &#43; &#39;\&#39; &#39; &#43;. Line 18 reads as: &#34;, model&#61;&#39; &#34; &#43; model &#43; &#39;\&#39; &#39; &#43;. Line 19 reads as: &#34;, colour&#61;&#39; &#34; &#43; colour &#43; &#39;\&#39; &#39; &#43;. Line 20 reads as: &#34;, price&#61;&#34; &#43;price &#43;. Line 21 reads as: &#39;}&#39;;.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />So now that we have our basic Car class defined, we could go ahead and save it, and now we could go inside our Main.java class, and inside public class Main we&#39;re going to define our Main method with Java is going to execute our program from. So public static void main. It&#39;s going to take a String array of arguments, and inside this method, we&#39;re going to be instantiating a new Car. So Car bmw on line 4 &#61; new Car. We&#39;re then going to have to pass in our constructor parameters. So the make is going to be a string bmw. The model will be a string x3. The color will be grey, and the price will be 30,000.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>In Main.java class, Line 1 reads as: public class Main {. Line 3 reads as: public static void main(String [] args) {. Line 4 reads as: Car bmw &#61; new Car(make: &#34;bmw&#34;, model: &#34;x3&#34;, colour: &#34;grey&#34;, price: 30000);. Line 5 reads as: }. Line 6 reads as: }.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So now that we have a new Car object, we could then do a System.out.println on line 5, and simply say bmw.toString which is going to return the string representation of our Car.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s go to File&gt;Save All. We could click on Main, right-click, and click Run &#39;Main.main&#34;. So we&#39;re going to open up the Build window and see the compilation and we could see that it executed. We have our make bmw, model &#61; x3, color gray, and price 30,000. Now if we wanted to change the price, for example, what we could do is we could say bmw.price &#61; 20,000 for example, and we save that and rerun it and we should now see that we actually have a price of 20,000. So this is just a very simple example of how we could define a class for a Car, define some instance variables. Define a constructor and then override the toString method, and then inside another main class, define a main method, and instantiate a new Car object, and call the toString method.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_3" /><h2 class="section_title">4.

<p>In this video, I&#39;ll talk about access modifiers in Java and how to use them. So there&#39;s four access modifiers in Java, Public, Private, Protected, and Default. Access modifiers help us in encapsulation and limiting the scope of classes, fields or variables, constructors, and methods in Java. The Default Access Modifier is applied if no access modifier is specified. The Public Access Modifier is the least restrictive, with the Private being the most restrictive, and Protected is in between Public and Private in terms of its restrictiveness.</p>
<p>So access modifiers can be set on fields or variables, constructors, methods, and classes. So an example of an access modifier on a field could be, within a class you could have, for example, a car class. You could have an instance variable price, so you could have a private int price, and that would set that price variable to only be accessible within that class. You could have access modifiers on constructors. So if you have a private constructor, it would only be accessible within the class and you wouldn&#39;t be able to call that constructor when instantiating a new object from outside the class. You could have access modifiers on methods. So, once again, you can have Private or Protected or Public methods that are only accessible either within the class or within the package by their classes. For classes, you could only have either the Default Access Modifier or the Public Access Modifier.</p>
<p>You cannot have the Private or Protected Access Modifier for classes. So first we&#39;ll talk about the Public Access Modifier. So the Public Access Modifier allows access from everywhere. Whether that be inside or outside of a class, or inside or outside of a package. So generally, our classes are defined with a Public Access Modifier, so that our classes could be instantiated from anywhere, from any class, anywhere in the program, and this is really used because it gives us the most flexibility in where the different classes, fields, methods, or constructors could be called from. The private access modifier is the most restrictive, and it basically only allows access within a class. So if we have private integer within a class, that integer is only accessible within that class, by the methods of that class. Any methods that try to call or update that variable from outside the class, even if they&#39;re in the same package, or even if they&#39;re child classes of that class, are not going to be able to modify that variable.</p>
<p>The Protected Access Modifier is in between the Public and Private Access Modifier in terms of restrictiveness. So it allows access to fields, constructors, and methods inside a package. So any class within that package can basically call anything that&#39;s Protected by the Protected Access Modifier. It also allows access to fields, constructors, and methods that are outside of a package, but that are part of a child class. So that could be, for example, if we have a class as shape, and then inside that shape class, we have a child class that extends a shape class called rectangle. So rectangle would be able to access everything, all the protected members of the shape class, and finally, we have our Default Access Modifiers. So that allows access inside a package, like the Protected Access Modifier does, and basically, if we don&#39;t specify anything in front of a field, constructor, class, or method, Java is going to revert to the Default Level Access Modifier. So let&#39;s take a look at examples of access modifiers. So we have public class Fruit. So remember, the classes can only be defined with either a Public or a Default Access Modifier. So we have Public class Fruit, and then we have Private Access Modifier on our instance variable price. So private int price &#61; 10.</p>
<p>So this means that anyone trying to access our int price outside of the Fruit class won&#39;t be able to. Now, below that, we have class Fruit. So notice we didn&#39;t put the Default Access Modifier because if we don&#39;t specify anything, the Default Access Modifier is used. We have protected int price, which essentially means that instance variable is going to be accessible by any class when in the package, as well as any child classes of the Fruit class. Now let&#39;s take a look at an example of using access modifiers. So here we&#39;re defining a class, multiply, with a Public instance variable called multiplier, and setting that to 10, and then we&#39;re going to have a public int multiply, which is going to be a method, and it&#39;s basically going to take a number to multiply, and notice that number doesn&#39;t have, we just have int numToMultiply, there&#39;s no access modifier in there, and then we&#39;re going to return numToMultiply times multiplier, which is set to 10.</p>
<p>Below that we have public class performCalc, and we have our main method, so public static void main, and inside that method, we&#39;re defining a new object, num1, of type multiply. We&#39;re instantiating it by calling new multiply, so instantiating the multiply class in the object num1, and then below that, we&#39;re running System.out.print line to print to the console num1.multiply(5). So we&#39;re calling that multiply method and passing in 5 for int number to multiply, and then it&#39;s going to return num to multiply times multiplier. So we&#39;re going to get 5 times 10, or 50, as the output to our console. Now, notice that if we change inside the class multiply, if we change this into multiply method, if we change the Access Modifier to Private. We would throw an exception in Java when we&#39;re compiling because we wouldn&#39;t be able to access that private int multiply method from public class perform calc because it&#39;s in a different class, and Private Access Modifiers only allow us to access methods within the same class.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_4" /><h2 class="section_title">5.

<p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to talk about modifiers and specifically using the private modifier in our classes. So here I am in my Ubuntu 18.04 environment and I have IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition open. I&#39;m going to click on New Project, and I&#39;m going to set the Java version as 1.8. Click Next, click Next, I&#39;m going to select a directory to put my project in. So under my home &gt;boris &gt;code directory &gt; java, I&#39;m going to put it into modifiers directory.</p>
<p>Click OK and my project name will be Car, and I&#39;ll click Finish. I now see that I have my basic project structure setup, and including my external libraries as well. So now I could click on my src directory and I could right-click and click on New&gt;Java Class. So we&#39;re going to be creating two classes similar to the previous demo. The first one&#39;s going to be Car and the second one is going to be Main. So let&#39;s start working on our Car class. So just like before, we&#39;re going to define some instance variables. So we going to have a String make, String model, String colour, and then int price for the Car.</p>
<p>We can now generate a constructor. So one trick to generate the constructor, we could right-click and click on Generate in IntelliJ IDEA and click on the Constructor, and we&#39;ll click Ctrl and select all four instance variables and click OK, and that&#39;s going to generate our constructor for us.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 7 reads as: public car(String make, String model, String colour, int price) {. Line 8 reads as: this.make&#61;make;. Line 9 reads as: this.model&#61;model;. Line 10 reads as: this.colour&#61;colour;. Line 11 reads as: this.price&#61;price;. Line 12 reads as: }.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />We could also right-click and generate a toString method. So click on toString, make sure all four instance variables are selected and click OK, and we have a toString method.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 14 reads as: &#64;Override. Line 15 reads as: public String toString() {. Line 16 reads as: return &#34;Car{&#34; &#43;. Line 17 reads as: &#34;make&#61;&#39; &#34; &#43; make &#43; &#39;\&#39; &#39; &#43;. Line 18 reads as: &#34;, model&#61;&#39; &#34; &#43; model &#43; &#39;\&#39; &#39; &#43;. Line 19 reads as: &#34;, colour&#61;&#39; &#34; &#43; colour &#43; &#39;\&#39; &#39; &#43;. Line 20 reads as: &#34;, price&#61;&#34; &#43;price &#43;. Line 21 reads as: &#39;}&#39;;.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So now let&#39;s go to our Main.java class and let&#39;s define our Main method. So public static, void Main, and we&#39;re going to take a string of arguments.</p>
<p>A string array of arguments. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 3 reads as: public static void main(String [] args) {.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So now what we could do inside here is we could instantiate on line 4 our new Cars. So Car bmw &#61; new Car, and we&#39;re going to call deconstructors. So we have to specify make, bmw, a model, x3, a colour, which will be grey, and a price which will be 30,000, and then we could go ahead and call the toString method on BMW object and display that with system.out.println on line 5.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 4 reads as: Car bmw &#61; new Car(make: &#34;bmw&#34;, model: &#34;x3&#34;, colour: &#34;grey&#34;, price: 30000);. Line 5 reads as: System.out.println(bmw.toString());. Line 6 reads as: }.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So let&#39;s go ahead, save that and just run program and make sure works just like in the previous demo. So we should expect to see we have our Car, so make&#39;s bmw, model&#39;s x3, colour is grey and price is 30,000. So now let&#39;s try to change the colour, so let&#39;s say bmw.colour &#61; red. So we want to get the red BMW instead of the grey one.</p>
<p>What we&#39;re going to do differently now from the previous demo however, is we&#39;re going to go back to the Car.java class, and under the instance variable for colour, we&#39;re going to say private String colour. So if we go ahead and save that, we could already see IntelliJ is already giving us a problem. So let&#39;s try and compile that and see what issue we get from the compiler. So we could see here, java colour has private access in Car. So since we&#39;ve set the instance variable colour to private. We can now no longer access it in the way we were accessing it before when it was public by simply doing object.instance variable. So how do we get around this? Because this is what we&#39;re going to need to implement in all our projects and here to encapsulation standards.</p>
<p>So one thing we could do is we could create getters and setters. So IntelliJ IDEA has a quick way of doing that with the generate method. So we could right-click and go to Generate, and we&#39;re going to select Getter and Setter. We&#39;re going to click Ctrl and select all four of our instance variables and click OK, and we can now see that we have getter and setters for each instance variables. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 14 reads as: public String getMake() {. Line 15 reads as: return make;. Line 16 reads as: }. Line 18 reads as: public void setMake(String make) {. Line 19 reads as: this.make&#61;make;. Line 20 reads as: }. Line 22 reads as: public String getModel() {. Line 23 reads as: return model;. Line 24 reads as: }. Line 26 reads as: public void setModel(String model) {. Line 27 reads as: this.model &#61; model;. Line 28 reads as: }.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So if we look the make one, getMake, between line 14 and 16, we can see that we&#39;re simply returning the make as a string.</p>
<p>Between lines 18 and 20, we have setMake, so we&#39;re actually taking a parameter of type string make, and we&#39;re setting the make-instance variable of the object to the make parameter that we&#39;re passing in. So now let&#39;s go ahead and set all our instance variables to private access, and then what we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re actually going to go ahead and we&#39;re going to call those getters and setters. So in our Main.java class, instead of on line 5 doing bmw.colour equals red, let&#39;s do bmw.setColour, and we&#39;ll pass red in as the string argument for that method. Now if we call the toString method, we&#39;re just going to save and rerun.</p>
<p>We should see that we&#39;re now actually getting the right BMW. We&#39;re not getting compilation error, which we are. Now let&#39;s try using a getter. So bmw.getPrice, and before that on line 7, let&#39;s actually do a bmw.setPrice. So we&#39;re going to change the price. So it&#39;s currently at 30,000 set on line 4. Let&#39;s set it to 50,000. So maybe we got the M model or something, and then we&#39;re going to run the bmw.getPrice on line 8, <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>In Main.java class, Line 7 reads as: bmw.setPrice(50000);. Line 8 reads as: bmw.setPrice();.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />which is going to return a string, and we could output that string with a system.out.println statement, and we should see that we&#39;re now actually going to have a price of 50,000. So let&#39;s go ahead and save and rerun, <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 8 reads as: System.out.println(bmw.getPrice());</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />and we could see here that our price is now 50,000. So by using getters and setters, we were able to use the proper encapsulation and set all our instance variables in our Car class to private, and now we have all the proper ways to access them from another class by utilizing our getters and setters that we created. So that&#39;s it for this demo.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_5" /><h2 class="section_title">6.

Your host for this session is Boris Misljencevic.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this video, I&#39;ll describe how members are used by classes in Java. So Java members are Instance Variables, are variables that define the state of a class, and the variables really are used to define attributes of a class. So we mentioned in a previous video about a car. So Instance Variables could relate to the car&#39;s make, model, price, and so on. So it describes the different attributes of a car, and they&#39;re declared within a class, and generally, Instance Variables are defined right after the class definitions right at the top of a class, and it could use access modifiers as well, with the private access modifier being preferred for encapsulation, and we want to define our Instance Variables outside of any methods or the class constructor.</p>
<p>So an Instance Variable gets created when an object is instantiated by using the new keyword. What ends up happening is that, Java allocates space on a memory heap for each Instance Variable. So any method within a class could access the Instance Variables and modify them, even if they&#39;re defined with the private access modifier, because even with the private access modifier, any method is able to access two different Instance Variables within the class and modify their states. So once an object is no longer needed and gets destroyed by the Java garbage collector. All the memory in the heap that was reserved for the Instance Variable is then released back for use with other things in the program. So with Instance Variables the order of defining them it&#39;s not important for example, in the car example.</p>
<p>We could have the model above to make or to make about the model, it doesn&#39;t matter when we&#39;re defining them. We can use access modifiers. So as we mentioned, we could have public, private, protected or if we don&#39;t specify any access modifier, it would just be default. The private access modifier is preferred for encapsulation reasons. However, and we will go over this more in other videos with getters and setters and how we can use the private access modifier with Instance Variables. So Instance Variables can also be set to default values. So for example, we could set the price of a car by default to be $20,000, and these default values could also be updated in the constructor bypassing parameters from the constructor calls. So for example, if we have a constructor for car and someone wants to instantiate a car object.</p>
<p>They could pass in the price for the car that they want, and that price could then update the Instance Variable within the car class, and as I mentioned, private is recommended for the access modifier for the Instance Variables, just because private gives us the best encapsulation and protects our data and that&#39;s very important in object oriented programming principles. So here&#39;s an example of some Instance Variables. So we have public class Car, and we have a private String make, and a private String model, which are attributes of a car, and then we have a constructor. So we have public Car, and the constructor takes two parameters.</p>
<p>It takes a string make and a string model. Now, notice that I&#39;ve actually used the same variable names as the Instance Variables in our constructor, so this is a common principle in Java, and basically, what we do to get around this is we use the this keyword. So this essentially references to this instance of the object. So by specifying this.make &#61; make;. We&#39;re saying the Instance Variable make is equal to the parameter make that we&#39;re passing into the constructor. So we have this.make &#61; make; and this.model &#61; model;. So we&#39;re essentially setting the default value of the make and model of the car when the constructor gets called, and whoever is responsible for calling the constructor with the new keyword is responsible for passing in the make and the model of the car into that car so that we can properly initialize our Instance Variables.</p>
<p>So another example of using Instance Variables, we have public class fruit. So notice we&#39;ve used the public access modifier for Instance Variable, so public String fruitType;. So this is going to be accessible to any class. We have our constructor public Fruit (String fruit1) and we&#39;re setting that fruitType to that parameter we pass in, and then we have public void displayfruit() { and we&#39;re just printing to console System.out.println(&#34; type of fruit: &#34;&#43; fruitType);. Below that we have our main method, public static void main[]. and we&#39;re defining a new fruit, object fruit1. So we&#39;re calling the constructor by using the new keyword, new fruit and we&#39;re passing in the parameter.</p>
<p>So if we look at the constructor, it takes one parameter, which is a string. So we&#39;re passing in the fruitType which is an apple, and then below that we&#39;re calling the displayfruit method(), and notice that, once again that has the public access modifier so we could call it and fruit1.displayfruit();, and we&#39;re going to get type of fruit, apple. So that&#39;s it for Instance Variables.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_6" /><h2 class="section_title">7.

<p>Let&#39;s get started. In this demo, we&#39;re going to go over programming class members in Java. Here I am in my Ubuntu 18.04 environment with IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition Open. Let&#39;s open the existing project from the Assets, so we&#39;ll click on Open and we&#39;re going to select the object and members project and click on OK. We could see here if we quickly go over it, it&#39;s very similar to the previous two demos. We have in our source directory two classes, a Car class and a Main class. Our Car class has several instance variables, we have a make, model, colour, price and an int for the horsepower of the Car. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 1 reads as: public class Car {.

Line 5 reads as: System.out.println(bmw.toString());. Line 6 reads as: }.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So now we could go ahead and right-click on Main and click Run Main.main. Inside our build window we should see that we build successfully and then we execute, and we could see the Car, make is bmw, model&#39;s x3, colour is grey, price is 30,000, horsepower is 250.</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s go back to our Car.java file, and we&#39;re going to be creating some more methods. So let&#39;s create a method called private, void setPower, and this method is not going to take any arguments and we&#39;re basically just going to have an if statement. So if, horsepower is less than 300, we&#39;re going to add an extra 50 horsepower,<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 56 reads as: private void setPower() {. Line 57 reads as: if(horsepower &lt; 300) {. Line 58 reads as: horsepower &#43;&#61;50;. Line 59 reads as: }. Line 60 reads as: }.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />and so this is a private member method so it can&#39;t be called from outside of the class. So we&#39;re going to call it from the public set horsepower method. So what we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re just going to call setPower, and notice that we&#39;re not returning anything from setPower. Because the horsepower instance variable is accessible to all methods inside the Car class.</p>
<p>So what&#39;s going to happen is if we enter in with a horsepower of the Car, if the current horsepower of the Car is under 300, we&#39;re going to add 50 to it, and then we&#39;re going to add the horsepower that we&#39;re passing in through that int horsepower parameter on line 52. For the setHorsepower method to the current horsepower. So let&#39;s go ahead and save that, and inside Main method, we could try and run that call. So let&#39;s do bmw. Let&#39;s set horsepower and let&#39;s try adding 50 horsepower. So now we should see the end result of 350 horsepower, because when we go inside the set horsepower method, the setPower method. Our current horsepower is only 250, we&#39;re going to add 50 on line 59 getting us to 300, and then we&#39;ll add the remaining 50 that we&#39;re passing in to the setHorsepower method.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s try running that and see what happens, and we could see we have 350 horsepower. Now what we could try is, just for fun, let&#39;s try calling that setPower method directly from Main class and see what happens. So bmw.setPower and we could see that it doesn&#39;t let us because it says setPower has private access in Car. So because of that encapsulation, that member method setPower can only be called from within the Car class. What we could do however, is change the access modifier to protected on line 57.</p>
<p>So that means that any class within the package including subclasses could now call that setPower method, and since our Main class is in the same package as our Car class, we can now actually call that setPower method. So you could see it&#39;s not giving us an error anymore if we now go and run. We could see we&#39;re getting 300 horsepower, which makes sense because we&#39;re calling setPower directly. So if horsepower is less than 300 on line 58 which it is it&#39;s 250, we&#39;re going to add 50 which is going to bump up our horsepower to 300, and then we&#39;re simply on line 6 in the Main method, doing bmw.toString to print out a string representation of our BMW object, and we&#39;re getting 300 horsepower. So that&#39;s how we could adjust and modify class instance variables and our class member methods.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_7" /><h2 class="section_title">8.

<p>In this video, we&#39;ll talk about different types of variables, Class Variables, instance variables and Local Variables, and how they relate to Java. Class or Static variables are variables that are defined with the static keyword within a class outside of a method and a constructor and there&#39;s only one instance of the class variable for the class. So if an object gets instantiated for that class, it&#39;s only going to have that same one instance of the class variable. Instance variables we took a look at before, and they essentially describe our different attributes of our class and they get created on runtime when the class gets instantiated, and they get deleted when a class gets deleted, and instance variables are unique to each object.</p>
<p>Local variables are variables that are only alive or existing within a method, and when that method exits, the Local Variables then get destroyed. They&#39;re unable to be accessed from outside of a method. So let&#39;s start talking about class or static variables. So Class Variables, as I mentioned, are declared using the static keyword. So for example, for an integer, you&#39;d have a static int price, for example. So they&#39;re declared inside a class, and they&#39;re declared outside of a method or a constructor. So the same place where an instance variable would be defined, and the important thing with static variables is that there&#39;s only one copy per class. So that essentially means that, for example, if we have a class car. If we keep instantiating objects of type car, we&#39;re going keep getting more and more instance variables. So each object is going to have its own instance variables. However, each object is going to share the same class variable.</p>
<p>So we&#39;re only going to have one copy of a class or static variable per class, and that variable will be able to be accessed by the class name. So for example, car, dot and then the static variable name for example, price. Whereas if we&#39;re accessing instance variables, we&#39;re going to write the object name, dot and then the instance variable name. So now let&#39;s talk about Instance Variables, which we&#39;ve already covered in some previous videos. So they&#39;re also known as member field variables. They&#39;re declared outside of a method or constructor within a class, and they&#39;re referenced by one or more methods. So the instance variables really define the different attributes of a class. For example, for a car we can have a make, model, color and price. As instance variables, they get initialized, usually within a constructor, and then different methods within the class could use the instance variables to update the object&#39;s state.</p>
<p>Finally, Local Variables, so Local Variables are declared in methods. They are created by the method, they&#39;re a call stack. So essentially when a method gets called, the Local Variables are pushed to the call stack, and then once the method exits, their popped from the call stack and they no longer exist. The scope of the Local Variables is only within a method. So for example, if we had two methods within a class and one method had a Local Variable called price. If the second method was trying to update that Local Variable price, it wouldn&#39;t be able to, because the scope of a Local Variable is only within the method that it&#39;s defined in. So let&#39;s take a look at an example, so we have public class variable types. So we have an instance variable that&#39;s a double, so double instance variable. Below that we have static int classVariable &#61; 10, and we have our main method.</p>
<p>So public static void main, it takes a string array of arguments, and we&#39;re setting int localVariable &#61; 100. So this Local Variable is only in scope inside that main method. So outside of the main method, if we try to access a Local Variable Integer, we wouldn&#39;t be able to because it would be outside of the method. Below that we&#39;re defining a new object of type variable types, and we&#39;re calling the default constructor with the new keyword, and then we have three System.out.println to print to the console. So the first one&#39;s going to print the class variable, and notice that to print the cost variable, we&#39;re going to write the class name. So variableTypes.classVariable, and that&#39;s going to output 10. Below that, we have System.out.print, and we have instance variable. So to print out an instance variable, we&#39;re going to specify the object name. So different from the class variable where we specify the class, in the instance variable we specify the object.</p>
<p>So object.instanceVariable, and then we&#39;re going to be printing out the value of that instance variable, and that is going to be 0.0 because it&#39;s a double and we didn&#39;t define any default value so it&#39;s going to revert to the default double value which is 0.0, and finally, the last System.out.print statement, we&#39;re printing the Local Variable and we&#39;re printing the value which it got set to 100, and we&#39;re going to see the Local Variable value as 100. So that&#39;s it for Class Instance and Local Variables.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_8" /><h2 class="section_title">9.

<p>Okay, let&#39;s get started. In this demo, we&#39;re going to be going over different types of variables. We&#39;re going to cover instance variables, class variables, and local variables. Here I am in my Ubuntu 18.04 environment and I have IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition open. What I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to go ahead and click the Open button and I&#39;m going to open up my variables project that exists in our code assets for this demo. I&#39;m going to click OK, and that&#39;s going to open up my project.</p>
<p>We could see just like in our previous demos and our source directory, we have two classes we have a main class and the Car class. The Car class is simply going to define a Car with some instance variables, which are going to find the attributes of a Car. So we&#39;re going to have the string make on line 3, on line 4 string model. Line 5 string colour, and on line 6 in price. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 1 reads as: public class Car {. Line 3 reads as: private String make;. Line 4 reads as: private String model;. Line 5 reads as: private String colour; . Line 6 reads as: private int price;.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Notice that we&#39;re also using the private access modifier for encapsulation purposes. So instance variables exist basically throughout the lifecycle of that instance of the Car class. So if we go to Main.java, we could see here that we&#39;re defining a new instance of the Car class called bmw, and we&#39;re calling the constructor by using the new Car keyword and</p>
<p>passing in parameters here on line 4.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>In Main.java class, Line 4 reads as: Car bmw &#61; new Car(make: &#34;bmw&#34;, model: &#34;x3&#34;, colour: &#34;grey&#34;, price: 30000);. Line 5 reads as: System.out.println(bmw.toString());. Line 6 reads as: }.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So basically what we&#39;re doing by passing in these parameters is that we&#39;re initializing the instance variables for that instance of the Car class. Now there&#39;s two ways we could go about editing. The values of instance variables. One way would be to just type in the object or the instance of the class that we want to edit, and then do a dot, and then we could for example, say colour &#61; red. So this only works if we don&#39;t have the private modifier in front of the colour instance variable which we do in this case on line 5. Because otherwise, we get the error message colour has private access in Car.</p>
<p>So one way we could get around this, which we covered in a previous demo is to actually create getters and setters. So if we take a look at colour we could scroll down between lines 31 and 33. We have public string getColour which returns our colour. We also have between lines 35 and 37. Public void setColour, which takes a parameter String colour and it sets the instance variable for that object using this keyword. So this colour is equal to the colour parameter we pass in. So we could try that instead of doing bmw.colour &#61; red, let&#39;s say bmw.set colour, and then we&#39;re going to pass in red as the string parameter to that method.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 5 reads as: bmw.setColour(&#34;red&#34;);.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>When we call the system.out.println on line 6, and we do a bmw.toString, we should now see that the colour is in fact going to be red. So we could go ahead and run the program and we should see that yes, we do have the colour as red. So that&#39;s it for the instance variables. Let&#39;s move on to the local variables. So let&#39;s go ahead and create a new private method within Car class, and it&#39;s just going to be called a unique colour. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>In Car.java class, line 47 reads as: private void uniquecolour().</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So what this method is going to be doing is we&#39;re simply going to specify a unique colour and set a colour to that method. So let&#39;s define a local variable here. So we&#39;re going to define String unique colour is equal to Aqua that&#39;s the final line 49, <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 49 reads as: String uniqueColour &#61;&#34;aqua&#34;;.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />and then what we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re going to set the colour to the uniqueColour so now we have this method, and we have a local variable, called uniqueColour, and that&#39;s set to Aqua. Well, instead of calling this method what if we just wanted to access, that uniqueColour, local variable, and, set the colour to the uniqueColour, inside, a public void set color method so let&#39;s try doing that. So colour is equal to unique.</p>
<p>Instead of calling the method itself, we could simply try to set it to that local variable and you see we can&#39;t do that. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 35 reads as: public void setColour(String colour) {. Line 36 reads as: colour &#61; uniqueColour;. Line 37 reads as: this.colour &#61; colour;. Line 38 reads as: }.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Because we get the error message cannot resolve symbol uniqueColour. This is because the local variable only exists in the context of that private void uniqueColour method defined between lines 48 and 52. Any method outside of uniqueColour that&#39;s trying to access that unique.Colour local variable will not be able to. Finally let&#39;s move on to class variables, I&#39;m just going to get rid of this method uniqueColour, and we could go over class variables. So class variables exist for the duration of the program, and they&#39;re defined with the static keyword.</p>
<p>So if we want a class variable horsepower, we could specify int static int horsepower, and we could set it to some value I&#39;d say 300. So this class variable is not associated to every single instance of the Car. It&#39;s actually associated to the Car class itself. So it is different from the instance variables. So if we go back to Main.java, one way we could edit class variables instead of having to instantiate the actual class as an object and then call the variable or the setter method from there. What we actually do is we call the class itself so Car.horsepower, and we could set a new value like 400.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>In Main.java class, line 6 reads as: Car.horsepower &#61; 400;.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So you could see that we&#39;re actually able to do this by directly calling the class instead of calling an instance of the class. For example, bmw, and just to make sure it works, we can actually go ahead and run and we will see that we get a program that&#39;s properly compiling.</p>
<p>So that&#39;s static, so that static variable on line 7 in the Car class static in horsepower is going to be valid for the duration of the program and it doesn&#39;t depend on the instance of the class getting garbage collected, such as the instance variables, and the same is true for method, so you could see our main method is declared with the static keyword. Because it&#39;s alive for the duration of the execution of the program. So that&#39;s it for instance variables, local variables, and static class variables in Java.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_9" /><h2 class="section_title">10.

Your host for this session is Boris Misljencevic.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this video, we&#39;re going to describe the concept of overloading and how it relates to methods and constructors in Java. So Java Constructor Overloading essentially lets us define multiple constructors that take different numbers of parameters. So basically what we could do is for example, if we have a car class. We could have a default car constructor that doesn&#39;t take in any parameters and just initializes our instance variables to default values. We could then also have a car constructor which takes in just the price and we could set the price, and we could finally have a car constructor that takes make, model, price and year of the car, and we could set all those instance variables in that constructor by the different arguments or parameters that we pass in. So, why should we use Java Constructor Overloading?</p>
<p>It&#39;s very useful for different objects. So different objects might have different uses. For example, we might just want to create a car and we might just care about the price. We don&#39;t care about the other values, we want them to be set to the default. So we don&#39;t have access to the other values to pass them into the constructor. So we could just call one constructor that just takes into price in that case. In order to do that, we&#39;re going to be using the new keyword to instantiate a new instance of the class. So, for example, for the car example, we could have car BMWs equals new car, and then within the brackets, we&#39;re going to specify what we&#39;re passing in. So we&#39;re going to specify the parameter list. So if we don&#39;t specify any parameters, that&#39;s going to call the default constructor with no parameters.</p>
<p>Or we could specify one to any number of instance variables for the different constructors that we&#39;ve defined within our car class. So some rules for Java constructors, they must be the same name as the class. So for example, if we have a class car, our constructor would be public car. So it has the same name as the class, and we never return a value. So unlike a method, a constructor is always void, so it never returns a value. So by defining a car constructor, we would just define public car and a list of arguments or parameters, and that&#39;s it.</p>
<p>We never have to worry about returning a value from a Java constructor. So the Constructor Syntax, to call a constructor we&#39;re going to use the new keyword to instantiate a new instance of a class. For example, here, we have myClass classVariable. So that&#39;s the object name, classVariable, and we&#39;re using new keyword to instantiate a new instance of my class. To pass an argument to a constructor, we&#39;ll do the same thing. So myClass classVariable &#61; new myClass. However, you could see here that brackets are left empty. To call the default constructor here, we&#39;re putting 100 in to pass in that integer. That&#39;s a parameter or argument to the myClass constructor. So we have multiple constructors in this case for different uses with different objects. So, another example of using constructors. So we have public class overloading.</p>
<p>We have a private string, myVar, and we have our constructors, so public overloading, and this constructor takes no arguments or parameters. So inside it, we&#39;re just setting myVar to a default string that&#39;s going to be hard coded, so testing overloading. Then we&#39;re going to have a second constructor that&#39;s going to take a string as a parameter, and we&#39;re going to use the this keyword. So we&#39;re passing in a string, myVar and this keyword specifies the instance variable that belongs to this object.</p>
<p>So this.myVar equals the string that we&#39;re passing in myVar. So in this case we&#39;ll be able to actually pass in a string customize the value of the myVar instance variable. Finally we have a public string, getMyVar so we have a getter here that&#39;s going to return myVar. The reason being is that we&#39;ve defined myVar with the private access modifier. So if we don&#39;t have that getter method, we won&#39;t be able to directly access myVar from outside of the class if we&#39;re trying to get that value. So next we have our main method and we&#39;re defining a new object of type overloading called overload1, and we&#39;re just calling the default constructor with the new keyword. So we&#39;re not passing in any parameters, and then we&#39;re going to do a System.out.print(overload1.getMyVar. So in this case, we should expect to have testing overloading because we&#39;re not actually updating that value. We&#39;re just calling the default constructor which sets myVar to testing overloading by default.</p>
<p>Under that, we&#39;re creating a second object of type overloading called overload2, and here we&#39;re calling that second constructor that takes a string parameter and we&#39;re passing in overloading worked. So in this case, we should see instead of testing overloading. We should see overloading worked because we&#39;re setting myVar2 to that value that we&#39;re passing in, and when we do a print on the line below, with overload2.getMyVar, we get overloading worked. So that&#39;s it for using Constructor Overloading.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_10" /><h2 class="section_title">11.

I&#39;ll put it in my code Java&gt;overloading directory and click OK and the project name will be Car and I will click Finish, and it&#39;s asking that it already exists.</p>
<p>Would you like to overwrite it? I&#39;ll say yes, and that&#39;s going to go ahead and create my project. I&#39;m going to be creating two classes just like before. We&#39;re going to have a Main class and we&#39;re also going to have a class called Car within our source directory. So let&#39;s build our Car class. So we&#39;re going to have some instance variables, so private String make; private String model; private String colour; and private int price, and we&#39;re also going to add another instance variable. So this one is going to be called allWheelDrive and it&#39;s going to be a Boolean, so private allWheelDrive. So now let&#39;s go ahead and generate a constructor getters and setters and</p>
<p>a toString method for our Car class. So we&#39;ll right click, go to Generate, I&#39;ll click on Constructor.

We&#39;re going to create Main method, so public static void main String args, and inside here, we&#39;re going to be instantiating Car object called BMW and passing in the parameters. So the make will BMW, the model will be x3, the Car will be grey, the price will be 30000, and the allWheelDrive we&#39;re going to pass true, and we&#39;re going to do System.out.println on line 5, and we&#39;re just going to do bmw.toString. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>In Main.java class, Line 4 reads as: Car bmw &#61; new Car(make: &#34;bmw&#34;, model: &#34;x3&#34;, colour: &#34;grey&#34;, price: 30000, allWheelDrive: true);. Line 5 reads as: System.out.println(bmw.toString());. Line 6 reads as: }.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So now let&#39;s save it and we could right click on Main and click on Run, and we&#39;re going to build it and we could see that everything works as expected. So we have our make bmw nodel x3 colour gray price 30000 allWheellDrive&#61;true. So we&#39;ve seen this in previous demos. Now let&#39;s go ahead and overload the constructors. So back to our Car class, inside this class, we&#39;re going to be creating two more constructors. So one is just going to be public Car and it&#39;s not going to take in any parameters. So in this case, we&#39;re going to initialize all the instance variables to default values without initializing them to the parameters of the constructor. So this.make, we&#39;re just going to leave it as an empty string, this.model will also be an empty string, this.colour, once again, empty string. this.price, so the price will be 0 and this.allWheelDrive will equal to false.</p>
<p>We&#39;re also going to go ahead and create another constructor that is simply going to take one parameter which is allWheelDrive. So it&#39;s going to be public here on line 24 Car and we&#39;re going to have a boolean allWheelDrive, and what we&#39;re going to do here is we&#39;re going to call this. By calling this on line 25, what that&#39;s essentially going to do is it&#39;s going to call our default constructor, which in this case is the Car constructor with no parameters defined between lines 16 and 22, and it&#39;s going to initialize all of our instance variables. and then what we could do below that is say this.allWheelDrive &#61;allWheelDrive. So we&#39;re going to set just the allwheelDrive parameter to that one we pass in into this Car constructor with only the allwheelDrive parameter. So now we have three constructors, three different ways. We could create a Car object. So let&#39;s go back to Main. So we have our original way defined up here, which is simply calling the constructor we defined between lines 8 and 14, which is going to pass in other five and six variables for the parameter values. Now we could create another one so let&#39;s call this one bmw2 &#61; new Car, and in this case, we&#39;re not going to pass it any parameters.</p>
<p>So we&#39;re simply going to create a Car with all the default parameters, and let&#39;s print that one out as well. So on line 7, System.out.println, and we&#39;re just going to do bmw2.toString, and finally, let&#39;s create one called bmw3 on line 8, new Car and we&#39;re simply going to specify true here for the allWheelDrive, and once again, we&#39;re going to do a System.out.println bmw3.toString. Let&#39;s save it and rerun it and let&#39;s see what happens. So we&#39;re just re-compiling and here it is. So we re-run it. So the first line is just like before, we have all five parameters and all of those show up in our to String, for instance, variable parameters. Next we have the one that gets called with, on line 6, we&#39;re creating bmw2, a new object, and on line 7, we&#39;re outputting the values of the instance variables for that object.</p>
<p>You can see here it&#39;s just set to the default values. So empty string for make, empty string for model, empty string for colour, price is 0, allWheelDrive is false. On line 8, we&#39;re creating a new Car with the third constructor we defined only taking the allWheelDrive parameter, we set that to true, and you can see the only difference between bmw2 and bmw3 is that allWheelDrive is set to true in bmw3, because we&#39;re explicitly passing that allWheelDrive parameter to true. You can notice that all the other values in bmw3 are the same as in bmw2, such as make, model, colour and price. This is because inside the Car class, we are calling this on line 25. So it&#39;s essentially calling the default constructor, which is that Car constructor that isn&#39;t taking in any parameters. Setting the default instance variable values, and then modifying the allWheelDrive value to the one we pass in to that Car constructor. So that&#39;s all for overloading constructors.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_11" /><h2 class="section_title">12.

<p>In this video, we&#39;re going to talk about how to instantiate a class with and without constructor parameters, and how to modify object fields. So a Java constructor can be Parameterized, and if it&#39;s Parameterized, that basically means that the constructor is going to take one to many arguments or parameters that get passed into it when a new object is instantiated. So to instantiate a new object, as we have seen before, we&#39;re going to use the new keyword and then after we&#39;re going to call the class name, which also happens to be the same name as the constructor, and then within the brackets, we&#39;re going to pass in the different parameters.</p>
<p>So we&#39;re going to have no parameters in some cases, if we just want to call the default constructor, or we&#39;re going to have up to as many parameters as we want to define for the constructor. These parameters are going to set the initial state of our object that we&#39;re creating. So let&#39;s take a look here at some constructors. So the first one has a single argument. So we have myClass that takes one argument or parameter of x, and that&#39;s going to be able to initialize any type of instance variable using that index argument. Next we have multiple arguments. So myClass, it&#39;s the same constructor definition. So we&#39;re just overloading that myClass constructor. However, the difference is that we&#39;re now passing in two parameters. So we have int x and int y, and finally, the last one, once again, we&#39;re overloading again, and we have myClass that takes three arguments int x, double y, string x. So in order to invoke Parametrized Constructor, we do that when we&#39;re creating a new object. So we have the type of object of the class.</p>
<p>So for example car, the object name, for example, BMW, and then we have equals new, and then we specify the class names. Again, which is also the constructor name. So new myClass. In this case, with no argument and we will just have an open brace and a close brace, and that would instantiate the constructor with just the default values without passing in any arguments. With multiple arguments, we have the same thing, however, now we&#39;re passing in the arguments we want. In this case, for myClass, it&#39;s two integers, 10 and 20 for the two arguments. Finally for the mix types, we can once again call new myClass and then we pass in 10, 100.0. So a double, and we pass in a string hello world. So how can we use the constructors? So we have a public class Java constructor and we have four constructors defined.</p>
<p>So the first one is just the default constructor that doesn&#39;t take in any arguments and prints System.out.print nothing. The second one takes two arguments, int x and int y, and we&#39;re going to print out the value of x plus y. The third one&#39;s going to take an int x, double y, float set and we&#39;re going to print out x&#43;y&#43;z. Finally, the last one is going to take an int and a string and we&#39;re going to print out the int x and then the string y. We have our main method and instantiating a new object of type Java constructor, and then the first case we&#39;re not passing in any arguments. In the second case, we&#39;re going to pass in 50 and 100 for the two integers when we&#39;re calling that second constructor.</p>
<p>In the third case, we&#39;re going to pass in 10, 20, and 30. So that&#39;s going to be an integer, a double, and a float, and in the last one we&#39;re going to pass in 100 for an integer and hello world for the string, and now, if you take a look here, the System.out.print on the first case it&#39;ll print nothing. In the second case, it&#39;s going to print x &#43; y. So we&#39;re going to get 50 &#43; 100 because those are the arguments we&#39;re passing in the constructor.</p>
<p>In the third case, it&#39;s going to print 10, and then since the second one&#39;s a double is going to print 20.0, and the third one is a float said we&#39;re going to print 30.0 because we&#39;re passing in 10, 20, and 30 as the arguments into the constructor, and finally for the fourth one, we&#39;re passing in 100 for the integer, so we&#39;re going to print 100, and then hello world for the string argument in a constructor and we&#39;re going to print hello world. So that&#39;s it for using Parameterized Constructors.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_12" /><h2 class="section_title">13.

<p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to take a deeper dive into constructors and ways to create constructors both with parameters and without parameters, as well as creating methods to modify instance variables and create copy constructors. So what you want to do here in my Ubuntu 18.04 environment when IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition up, we&#39;re going to open up the asset for this demo, it&#39;s called overloading is the project name. So open up that overloading project name and it&#39;s a Car project. You can notice just like in our previous projects we had our source directory two classes, car and Main. So the car class defines a Car and the Main class runs our program by instantiating a Car object and printing out the instance variables to the command line. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>In Main.java class, Line 3 reads as: public static void main(String [] args) {. Line 4 reads as: Car bmw &#61; new Car();. Line 5 reads as: System.out.println(bmw.toString());. Line 6 reads as: }.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So you can notice here in our Car class, the difference from before is that we actually don&#39;t have a constructor. So we could actually in Java create a class without a constructor and it will compile and run.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>In Car.java class, line 1 reads as: public class Car {.

So you can see here in our Main method on line 4 and set ourMain.java class file.</p>
<p>We&#39;re creating a new BMW object or a new Car object called BMW on line 4, and then we&#39;re calling system.out.print line bmw.toString to print the attributes or the instance variables of that object. So let&#39;s go ahead and run that, and we&#39;ll see what happens, we can see that the make is null, model is null, colour is null, price is 0, and allWheeldrive is false. So that&#39;s just calling the default constructor that&#39;s actually not even defined by us, but it exists within Java. So now let&#39;s go ahead and generate standard constructor. So we&#39;ll right click, go to Generate &amp;gt; Constructor, and we&#39;ll select with Ctrl, select all five of our instance variables, hit OK, and we can also generate a constructor that takes no instance variables or that takes no parameters.</p>
<p>So just public Car, and inside here we can initialize our instance variables to anything we like. So let&#39;s just copy this over, and the make, we&#39;ll just leave it as an empty string, the model will be an empty string as well, the colour be an empty string, the price will be 0, and this all wheel drive will set to false. So now we have two constructors. We have one that takes parameters, that&#39;s defined between lines 8 and 14, and one that doesn&#39;t defined between line 16 and 22. Now what we have to do is we could see we could call it two ways, either way we&#39;re calling the line 4 without any parameters or we could also call it the way we&#39;re going to do on line 6. So we&#39;re going to create our new Car object called bmw2.</p>
<p>Now we&#39;re going to pass in all the parameters, so the make is going to be BMW, the model will be X3, colour will be grey, Price will be 30,000 and allWheelDrive will be set to true, and then we could also print this out on line 7 or call system.out.println bmw2.toString. So let&#39;s just run this and make sure everything works as expected. So we should see that we now have one that&#39;s getting defined with that default constructor with no parameters. So make, model, colour are just going to be empty strings, price will be 0, all wheel drive is false, and then we have one that gets defined by the parameters that we pass in for each instance variables. So make is BMW, model is X3, colour is grey, price is 30,000, all wheel drive is true. Okay, so let&#39;s create a method now inside Car class that&#39;s going to be called increasePrice and int increment.</p>
<p>So this method is simply going to increase and of course it&#39;s going to be a public void. It&#39;s going to increase the price of our Car object by the increment. So we could specify this.price, Plus equals increment, okay? and then we could call that from our Main class, so when we create bmw2, let&#39;s call it bmw2.increaseprice and we could say for example 10,000. So it&#39;s going to increase our price by $10,000, and then if we rerun it, we should see that we now have a price of $40,000 for that bmw2 Car object. So now that we&#39;ve talked about creating a method inside our Car class, we&#39;ve talked about different ways we could create instructors, let&#39;s go ahead and create a copy constructor.</p>
<p>So copy constructor essentially takes one object as a parameter of the same type and copies it into another object of the same type. So we&#39;ll create a third constructor on line 24. So public Car and it&#39;s going to take a Car object as a parameter, and what we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re simply going to copy all our instance variables, and we&#39;re going to say this.make equals car.make this.model equals car.model. So essentially just copying one object to another by copying all the instance variables. This.colour equals car.colour, this.price, car.price, and this.allWheelDrive equals car.allWheelDrive.</p>
<p>So you can see we have all our instance variables are being copied from that Car object we&#39;re passing in. Now let&#39;s go back to our Main class. So inside here, let&#39;s create a new Car object called bmw3 equals new Car and we&#39;ll call that copy constructor by passing in bmw2 inside it, and then we could do a system.out.println, and we should expect if we print out in bmw3.toString that we actually get the same result as bmw2.toString. Because what we&#39;re going to be doing is essentially just copying all the attributes, all the instance variable values into bmw3 from bmw2. So let&#39;s go ahead and run that, and we can see that the result is identical. So we have make BMW, model X3, colour grey, price 40,000, allWheelDrive equals true for both of them, that bmw2 Car object into the new Car object called bmw3. So that&#39;s all for deep dive into constructors, and I hope you have enjoyed this course.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_13" /><h2 class="section_title">14.
