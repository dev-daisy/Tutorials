I&#39;ve been a software developer and tech consultant for almost a quarter of a century. I&#39;ve traveled around the globe to serve clients, where I&#39;ve been responsible for building secure systems, hiring development teams, and solving complex problems through technology with my toolbox of languages, platforms, frameworks, and APIs.<br />
<p>I round out my technical experience with an academic background in mathematics and computer science. Oracle&#39;s 1Z0-811 Java Certified Foundations associate certification is targeted to audiences seeking foundational knowledge of the Java programming language and concepts. Individuals tackling this certification will demonstrate they can write and execute a Java program, work with Java Development Kit, JDK, and the Java Runtime Environment, JRE.</p>
<p>The Java programming language is a simple and powerful language to learn. In this course, I&#39;ll explore the Java programming basic and the Java programming style guide. First, I&#39;ll discuss basic elements of Java including keywords, comments, variables, identifiers, and data types. Next, I&#39;ll cover the conventions that should be followed when writing Java programs regarding formatting, naming conventions, programming practices, and using Javadoc.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll then move to using the viz keyword in a Java application to help understand scope. Finally, we&#39;ll jump into using Java packages including the Java.lang package.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_1" /><h2 class="section_title">2.

<p>In this video, I&#39;ll present some of the basic elements of Java including keywords, comments, variables, identifiers, and data types. Object-oriented programming is a methodology based on defining objects that contain properties and methods. A Java object is a stateful entity with associated behaviors and it&#39;s meant to represent a physical or conceptual thing such as the cat, a chair, or a list. The class is an entity blueprint to instantiate objects and can be conceptually extended via sub classes to create further blueprints. And objects methods are the actions that can be performed on the instance and are defined by the class blueprint.</p>
<p>Attributes are represented as variables within a class and instance variables of the instantiated object. These can represent data type such as int, long, float, Boolean, enumerations or enums, and even other classes. Java has syntax rules that a program must follow. Every Java program requires a main() method. This is the entry point into the program where the Java Runtime Environment will start executing. And it has a particular syntax which I&#39;ll demonstrate in the video titled Programming Basic Java.</p>
<p>All identifiers in Java are case sensitive. This applies to class names, attributes, methods, and any other identifier types and keywords. Classes in Java are named. The first letter of a class name is typically in uppercase, subsequent words in a class name should be capitalized as well. For example, a class called My Form, the M in My and the F in Form are capitalized. There are some conventions for Java basic syntax for file and method names as follows.</p>
<p>Java class names should match the file name it&#39;s contained in, and it&#39;s done in a case sensitive way. This is not a strict rule, but it&#39;s an expected convention you should follow. Method names within a class should begin with a lowercase letter. Any additional words should start with an uppercase letter. This is known as camel case. If you have a method name called getName, the g in get is lowercase but the N in Name would be uppercase. Java consists of several constructs that combined to form the basics of the Java programming language.</p>
<p>Some of the constructs are as follows. Since Java 5.0, we&#39;ve had enumerated types which can be used to provide a list of predefined values. These are useful to restrict the valid choices for a value that can be chosen. We have arrays that store multiple values of the same type and is stored on the heap. The values in the array can be accessed by an index value which begins counting from 0. The values can also be accessed using a for-each loop.</p>
<p>Keywords in Java are special reserved words that are part of the Java syntax. Because they are reserved words, class, method, and variable names cannot be a reserved word. Another construct is identifiers. Names used for methods, variables, and classes are called identifiers. Identifiers must start with either an alphabetic character, an underscore character, or the dollar sign character. And identifiers cannot be keywords and they cannot begin with a number, although they can contain numbers. Java contains both access and non-access modifiers.</p>
<p>Access modifiers indicate which classes have access to the class, method, or variable. Non-access modifiers include final, abstract, and strictFP. Final means the class cannot be inherited from. Abstract means the class cannot be instantiated into an object. And strictFP restricts floating point calculations. And variables in Java can be a local variable, a static class variable, or a non-static instance variable. And that concludes this presentation on Java basic elements.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_2" /><h2 class="section_title">3.

<p>In this video, I&#39;ll demonstrate some of the basics of Java including keywords, comments, variables, identifiers, and data types. In the video titled Java Basic Elements, I shared slides covering the basic elements. In this video, we&#39;ll see the basics firsthand. In Java code, it&#39;ll point out some of the details we need to remember.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A IntelliJIDEA window titled, BasicElements-Main.java appears on the screen, showing various lines of code.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So in the first line, in this Main.java file, I declare the package. So I have the keyword package, followed by com.example, followed by a semicolon to end the line. So this is typical to see the package.</p>
<p>It&#39;s required that it&#39;s the first thing we have in a file that belongs to a package. Then on line 3, I declare public class Main. The body of the Main class is enclosed in braces. And since we&#39;ve declared a class as public, it has to belong in a file of the same name. So Main with capital M has to appear in Main.java with capital M in Main. So the public class has to match the file name. Then on line 4, I have static String greeting &#61; &#34;Hello&#34;.</p>
<p>So we have our static keyword which is a modifier to say that this variable can be accessed without having to instantiate the class Main first. So it&#39;s static. So it&#39;s always there. It always exists. Then I declare a function, private static void greet and it&#39;s parameter in paranthesis (string recipient). And then in the body of this function, I call System.out.println. I pass the variable greeting, which I get from the class, &#43; the string &#34;, &#34; &#43; recipient &#43; &#34;!&#34;.</p>
<p>So it will print a greeting using the greeting, &#34;Hello&#34;. Now the modifiers we have on this function are private and static. Private meaning it can&#39;t be accessed by anyone other than other methods inside of Main. So it&#39;s private to Main. Static is that it always exists, it doesn&#39;t require on instantiating the class Main first. And then on line 9, we have a very special function, the main function, the entry point into our application which is declared public static void main, with String[], so open and close square brackets, followed by args.</p>
<p>The standard declaration for the main function which is called by the JVM when the program starts. Then I have a comment with /* write your code here */. And then on line 11, I have int_i. So we have a variable name that begins with an underscore and this is okay because variables can begin with an underscore. On line 12 I have char $c, which is also okay because variables can begin with the dollar sign. But on line 13 I have byte followed by 8b.</p>
<p>And this is bad because comments cannot begin with a number. So if we&#39;d like to compile and run this code we can&#39;t have line 13. So I have to comment that out. And then on line 14 I have double_float. Now I&#39;m trying to create a double so double&#39;s the type, with the variable name of float. But float is also a reserved word and it&#39;s also a data type so it cannot be used as a variable name. So I&#39;ll have to comment out that as well. Then on line 16 I have String with a capital S, so it&#39;s the type of string. And then string as the variable name.</p>
<p>But the string, the variable name, is all in lowercase. This is fine because reserved words are case sensitive as well. So string, lowercase, is okay for a variable name, not recommended, it&#39;s not a great variable name because there is some confusion, but it&#39;s valid. And I set that &#61; to args indexed at 0. So it&#39;s going to take the first argument passed into main, save it in the variable string, and I&#39;m going to call greet(string) on line 17. So I call the function and pass the variable. Now before I run this code, we need to pass an argument in.</p>
<p>So I go to the Run menu select Edit Configurations. And where it has Build and run, so it has Java 8 SDK, com.examples.Main, and then the arguments. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A dialog box titled: Run/Debug Configurations displays. The left pane displays a tab titled: Application. Underneath the tab display a Main tab. Currently, the Main tab is selected. The right pane display the following input fields, including: Name, Build and run, Working directory, and Environment variables.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />And in here I put World. So we pass the string World into this program. Now I can run the program by going to the Run menu and selecting Run &#39;Main&#39;, or using Shift&#43;F10.</p>
<p>And when I run the program I get, Process finished with exit 0. And in the output I have Hello, World!, exactly the output that was specified in the greet function by System.out.println. So everything works fine. And that concludes this demonstration of programming basic Java.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_3" /><h2 class="section_title">4.

Your host for this session is Steve Scott.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this video, I&#39;ll describe the conventions that should be followed when writing Java programs in regards to formatting, naming and programming practices. When writing code in Java, there are several style guides that can be used for writing your code. Considerations need to be made when selecting the style guide that works best for you. So have a look at Sun Java style guide, the original Sun Java style guide, as well as Google&#39;s and Twitter&#39;s. These are all publicly available.</p>
<p>Creating consistent code is crucial when working in large teams or external teams. If you stray too far from the Java norms built up over the past quarter of a century, it just makes it on boarding harder. Because you&#39;re not only teaching new developers the details of a code base, but you&#39;re also wrangling a non-standard style at the same time. The build tools you use may determine the style guide you use since the tools such as Maven have plugins to auto format code. As you write, tools like IntelliJ make formatting changes automatically, such as indentations, function blocks and Java doc comment blocks.</p>
<p>Java file names must be the same as the public class name in the file so the JVM knows its entry point. If an interface is being defined, then the file name must match the name of the interface. Common file names and class names and interface names are usually nouns or noun phrases. When you&#39;re creating a class, the class is the object and the methods are the verbs. Stick to camel casing for fields, methods and variable names.</p>
<p>Java source file names must have the .java for the source file, which get turned into .class for the compiled byte code. And .jar for the Java archive files. There are typical conventions that are followed when organizing Java files. Source files should start with a comment block, the package name, and import statements and then followed by any class or interface declarations. The initial comment block should contain information on the name of the class, the version, the date, and any copyright or licensed information, if necessary. The statements for creating a package or importing a package, class or interface should appear next.</p>
<p>Classes and interfaces should be created with the class or interface statements appearing first, followed by the class, static variables, instance variables, constructors and methods. When indenting and writing a line of code, there are some conventions that should be followed. Indentation should be set to four spaces and a single line of code or comment should be less than 80 characters wide so that the line of code is visible on a screen of any common display size. So 80 is your minimum.</p>
<p>When a line needs to be wrapped, certain considerations need to be made as well. The line break should be done before and operator and after a comma. The second line of code should align in terms of indentation with the previous line of code that had the line break. Java has several methods for adding comments to the code. Some of the methods for adding comments are as follows. We have block comments, which are surrounded by slash star and star slash at the end of the block and are used to add descriptions before methods, algorithms, and data structures.</p>
<p>A block line should be added before the block comment. Single line comments are indented at the same level as the code they proceed. They&#39;re useful for adding information about a line of code, but don&#39;t overdo this style and use it sparingly. Trailing comments are comments that appear on the same line as the code and are usually short and typically use block comment style. End-of-line comments are similar to trailing comments. The main difference is the syntax used for end-of-line comments, which are the two forward slash comments.</p>
<p>Some comments follow the Java doc convention and add special symbols to the comment blocks so that they can be processed by the Java doc tool to generate documentation. Flow control statements in Java, such as loops and exception handling, follow a specific syntax based on the type of statement. Across all of these statements, the code blocks belonging to the statement, called its body, are within braces. The for statement is a loop that starts with the for keyword, followed by the initialization condition, an update or increment section, with each section separated by a semi-colon and all enclosed in parentheses.</p>
<p>The while statement is a loop that starts with the while keyword with a single condition containing a Boolean condition on whether to continue looping. The do-while statement is a loop that begins with the do keyword, followed immediately by the loop body and braces. And just outside of the closing brace is the while keyword, with its condition enclosed in parentheses. The switch statement is the flow control statement, which starts with the switch keyword, followed by the condition in parentheses, followed by zero or more case keywords and the default keyword.</p>
<p>Code blocks after the case and default statements end with a break statement unless you want the program to fall through to the next case or default section. One of the more common errors when writing switch statements is forgetting the break keyword to end a case. Then the try-catch statement is Java&#39;s flow control for exception handling, which starts with the try keyword, followed by a try block, enclosed in braces, followed by a catch section and, optionally, a finally section can be added if necessary. The catch keyword is followed by the exception class to be caught in parentheses.</p>
<p>Statements in Java should follow specific conventions when being written based on the type of statement being written. Each line of code should contain a simple statement. Compound statements are enclosed in braces and should be indented one level past the brace. Braces should be used when they&#39;re part of a control statements, such as an if-then-else statement. Return statements to return control to the calling method of a function does not need to enclose the return value in parentheses.</p>
<p>If you use parentheses as part of a return, it should only be for clarity in the return value itself. Otherwise, parentheses should not be used. If-then-else statements have blocks with enclosing braces for each section. A block that contains only one line of code can leave out the braces, but some coding conventions recommend not leaving out the braces ever, even for one-line blocks. And that concludes this presentation on Java style guide.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_4" /><h2 class="section_title">5.

Your host for this session is Steve Scott.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this video, I&#39;ll demonstrate the conventions that should be followed when writing Java programs with regards to formatting, naming conventions, programming practices, and Java doc style comments.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The IntelliJ IDEA window titled, JavaConventions-Event.java appears on the screen, showing various lines of code.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />So I have open in my IDE, the Event.java file I&#39;ve created. And at the beginning of this file, on line 1, I have package com.example. So the first line in any Java source file, other than a comment block, is always the package declaration, if there is one. Then I have public class Event, with a capital E on event to match the Event.java file. So the name of the class, including its case, so a public class declaration must match the name of the file that it&#39;s contained in.</p>
<p>Then on line 5, I have the beginning of a block comment, /*. In this case, I have /**, * on the next line, Constructor, and then */ to end the comment. Now the reason there&#39;s a double asterisk is that when I do it to block comment in IntelliJ, in this IDE, it will automatically populate it if I put /** and Enter. And it automatically creates the block comment, including the closing tags, and it puts me right where I need to be to type in the comment I want to type in.</p>
<p>So, in this case, Constructor, and then I declare the Constructor, public Event followed by open and close parentheses, and then the body of the method. So, when Event gets created, this function will be called and I could just call System.out.println(&#34;Event created!&#34;). So I print the text. Then, on line 12, I declare a method belonging to this class. I declare it, public static void doSomething(int importantValue). Now, in this case, the function doesn&#39;t need to be static, but I&#39;ve declared it that way, which means I can call it without creating an instance of an event.</p>
<p>On line 13, I have System.out.println, with the string Important value. Then I break the line, or I put a new line in, and then on line 14, I have &#43;, followed by importantValue, and then I close the function called println. When there&#39;s a line break like this, if it&#39;s a function call with a number of arguments separated by commas, I leave the comma on the preceding line before my new line. But if it&#39;s an operation with an operator, like &#43;, I put the new line in first and then the &#43; falls on the next line. So when you&#39;re breaking a statement up into multiple lines, the operations go on the new line, and commas go on the preceding line.</p>
<p>So that&#39;s the convention that we follow with Java. Then on line 16, in this code block I put in a single line comment, and this comment is indented to line up with the code. So it&#39;s very important if you have single line comments that it matches the indentation of the code that it&#39;s with. So it matches the System.out.println, indented under my if statement. So this system just prints, We received a negative value. So if importantValue is negative, if it&#39;s less than 0, we print this string, informing the user that that&#39;s the case.</p>
<p>Then I have else if, importantValue &gt; 20. And this just prints using System.out.println(&#39;Pick a smaller number.&#39;). And then I have an else with a trailing comment. So, /* importantValue is between 0 and 20 */. So this is a comment to say that if we get into this else block, the important value is between 0 and 20. The case that&#39;s not taken care of by our previous if and else if blocks. So, in this block, I have a for loop. The first clause is, int loop&#61;0; loop &lt; importantValue; loop&#43;&#43;.</p>
<p>And the body of this loop just does, System.out.println of the loop variable. So this is the value that gets incremented on each step of the loop. Now I&#39;ll switch over to my Main.java, and we can have a look at how this program gets executed and its entry point. So I begin with package com.example. So it&#39;s in the same package as Event.java. So I don&#39;t need to import Event.java explicitly, this import com.example.Event is unnecessary. So I can use Event because it&#39;s in the same package. So I just delete that line because it&#39;s not needed.</p>
<p>And on line 4, I have public class Main, Main matching the file it&#39;s contained in, including its case. Then in the body of Main, I have a comment, a block comment, but in the Java doc style. So main entry point, and then &#64;param, so the at symbol, args. So here I can put in a description of the args param. And I can put in args[0] is expecting an integer. So that just documents the method.</p>
<p>So I have the usual main function, public static void main, with string, double brackets args as its parameter. The default comment that gets put in by IntelliJ is, // write your code here. And then I create an instance of event. So, Event e &#61; new Event, with parentheses. And then on line 15, e.doSomething. So I call the doSomething method with integer.parseInt of args of 0. Now I&#39;d like to run the code, but before I run it, I&#39;m going to go into Run &gt; Edit Configurations, and go to Build and run.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A dialog box titled, Run/Debug Configurations appears on the screen.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />In the Program arguments input, I&#39;m going to put in a value, let&#39;s put in -20. Press OK, and now I&#39;ll use Shift&#43;F10 to compile and run the code. And it shows in the output, Event created, so the constructor prints its message, Important value: -20. And we received a negative value, and the program finished with exit code 0. So everything worked. And I can go into Run, again, Edit Configurations, change the value from -20 to 100. Press OK. And I can select Run with Shift&#43;F10.</p>
<p>And now I get the output of, Event created, important value is a 100. And it says pick a smaller number. Okay, well, I&#39;ll go back into Run &gt; Edit Configurations. And this time in the input, I&#39;m going to pass 10. Okay, Shift&#43;F10, and we get a different output. And if I go into the output and scroll up, I get Event created, Important value 10. And then on each line, I get the numbers from 0 to 9, and then it exits that loop that it got into. And the program exits, it finishes with exit code 0, successfully. And that concludes this demonstration of programming conventions in Java.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_5" /><h2 class="section_title">6.

Your host for this session is Steve Scott.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this video, I&#39;ll go through the majority of reserved words in Java. These are keywords or programming related terms that cannot be used for class names, method names, nor variable names. They can&#39;t be used outside of their original purpose. Compilers or IDEs should catch inappropriate uses of these, but sometimes invalid use results in valid syntax. And you can avoid some extra debugging by avoiding using them incorrectly in the first place. So let&#39;s start off with some keywords in Java that are special, reserved words that are part of the Java syntax.</p>
<p>We have abstract, which is a non-access modifier used by classes and methods to indicate that it has no body and no concrete implementation. Assert is used to stop execution if the predicate evaluates to false. It&#39;s a very useful debugging method. Boolean is a basic data type to represent true or false. Break is used to jump out of a loop or a switch statement. Byte is a data type that stores an 8-bit data value. Case is used with the switch statement to designate a block of code. Catch is used to catch exceptions generated by try statements.</p>
<p>Char is a data type that stores a single character. And class is used by Java to define a new class. Then we have continue, used to move to the next iteration of a loop. Const is a common C&#43;&#43; keyword for defining a constant value, but it&#39;s not used in Java, but it is still reserved. In Java we use the final keyword to define a constant value instead. Default is used in a switch statement and specifies a block of code that&#39;s executed by default. Do is used with the while keyword to perform a do while loop. Double is a floating point data type.</p>
<p>Else is used in if-then-else conditional block. Enum is used to declare enumerated type. Exports is used to export a module within a package. And extends is used to indicate that a class inherits from another class. Final is a non-access modifier that indicates a class, method, or variable that cannot be overwritten or modified. Finally is used with a try-catch block to indicate a block of code that will run even if no exception occurs. Float is the 32-bit floating point number data type.</p>
<p>For is for creating a for loop. goto is not used in Java and it has no function but it&#39;s still a reserved word. If is used to create a conditional statement. Implements is used when implementing an interface. Import is used when importing a class, interface, or package. And instanceof is used to determine if an object is an instance of a particular interface or class.</p>
<p>Int is the data type used to store a signed integer. Interface is like an abstract class and can only contain abstract methods. Long as the data type used to store a 64-bit signed integer. Module adds a higher level of aggregation above packages and introduced in Java 9. Native specifies that a method is implemented in another language. New is a keyword used to instantiate new objects. Package is used to create a package that groups together classes. Private is an access modifier to keep a method or variable private within a given class.</p>
<p>Protected is an access modifier that indicates an attribute or method or constructor is accessible in the class, the package, and by subclasses. Public is another access modifier, indicating a class constructor variable or method is accessible by other classes. Requires indicates that a library is needed inside a module and this was introduced in Java 9. Return is used to exit from a method. Short is the datatype used to store 16-bit integers. Static is used to indicate that a variable or method can be used without instantiating a class.</p>
<p>Strictfp is used to restrict the rounding and precision of a floating point calculation. Super is used to reference and execute methods in a parent class. Switch is a flow control statement used to compare values and execute code based on those values. Synchronized is a non-access modifier that indicates a method can only be accessed by a single thread. This is a reference to the current object that the method or a constructor that it&#39;s contained in.</p>
<p>Throw is used to throw an exception and is usually used with custom exceptions. Throws is used to indicate a method that can throw a specific exception. Transient is a non-access modifier that indicates that a data member will not be serialized. Try is used to indicate a block of code that should be tested for exceptions. A catch or finally statement must occur after a try statement. Var is used to declare a variable. Void indicates that a method has no return value.</p>
<p>Volatile is used to indicate that a variable may change asynchronously. And while is used to start a while loop. And that concludes this presentation on Java reserved words.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_6" /><h2 class="section_title">7. Video: Using the Java This Keyword ( it_sdjcfa_07_enus_07)</h2><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/public/b/1fefa011-5e87-4b62-b6bd-8c2f84a765ea/image001.jpg" alt="" width="300" onclick="(()=>document.getElementById('lb-image').src = 'https://cdn2.percipio.com/public/b/1fefa011-5e87-4b62-b6bd-8c2f84a765ea/image001.jpg')();" /><div class="section_text"><p>In this video, you will learn the use of &#39;this&#39; keyword.

Your host for this session is Steve Scott.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this video, I&#39;ll demonstrate this keyword and how you can interact with variables of the same name based on their scope. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The fileThisDemo-Main.java displays in the IntelliJ IDEA interface. The Main.java file is open in the editor pane. It contains few lines of code.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />So I&#39;m starting off in my Main.java file with package com.example and then I declare my public class main. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 1 reads: package com.example;.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And in the body of main, I have the entry point, the function main, public static void main with String, double brackets, args.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 3 reads: public class Main {. Line 4 reads: public static void main(String[] args) {.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And inside of the body of this method, I&#39;m using the class Greet to create the object g &#61; new Greet. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 5 reads: Greet g &#61; new Greet();.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And then I call the method g.sayGreeting with Hi, Steve.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 6 reads: g.sayGreeting(greeting: &#34;Hi&#34;, recipient: &#34;Steve&#34;);.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And one of the nice things about IntelliJ is that it gives me these hints so it shows greeting: Hi, recipient: Steve. So it shows which parameters are being set by these arguments. And if I don&#39;t like that view, I can always disable hints and hit OK. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>He right clicks over the code in line 6. A context menu appears. It contains the following options, including: Disable Hints for Method &#39;sayGreeting&#39;, Disable Hints, and Hints Settings. He selects the option: Disable Hints for Method &#39;sayGreeting&#39;. A dialog box titled: Parameter Name Hints Exclude List appears.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And it removes those hints provided by the IDE.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The code in line 6 now reads: g.sayGreeting(&#34;Hi&#34;, &#34;Steve&#34;);.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Now I&#39;ll switch over to Greet.java and here this is part of the same package, com.example. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Various lines of code displays.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />And this is a public class Greet. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 3 reads: public class Greet {.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />It contains a private static string greeting, which is equal to the string, Hello. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 4 reads: private static String greeting &#61; &#34;Hello&#34;;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And I declare my method on line 6, public void sayGreeting, and my parameters are defined String greeting, String recipient.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 6 reads: public void sayGreeting(String greeting, String recipient) {.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And then in the body of this method I have String message. So I declare a string message, then I test the greeting parameter, there&#39;s two greetings. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 7 reads: String message;.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />There&#39;s one that&#39;s the parameter defined as part of the method, so we receive the argument for this variable.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>He highlights the code in line 6.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And there&#39;s greeting the static member variable as part of the class Greet. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>He highlights the code in line 4.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So on line 8, I have if greeting.isEmpty, so this greeting is actually the parameter. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 8 reads: if(greeting.isEmpty()) {.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So in the precedence order, when there&#39;s two variables of the same name that are in the scope, the local one always gets precedence. So the parameter I&#39;ve defined here, greeting, is the one that&#39;s referenced if I just type greeting. If I want the one that belongs to the class that&#39;s defined outside of the method, I have to supply the this keyword. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 9 reads: message &#61; this.greeting &#43; &#34;, &#34; &#43; recipient &#43; &#34;!&#34;;.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So if the string is empty, I set message equal to this.greeting. So it falls back on the class&#39;s greeting variable, plus the string comma space plus the variable recipient plus the string with the exclamation mark. Else, so else means that greeting is not empty, I have message equals greeting, so it will take the local greeting. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 10 reads: } else {. Line 11 reads: message &#61; greeting &#43; &#34;, &#34; &#43; recipient &#43; &#34;!&#34;;.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Now the nice thing about the IDE, as soon as I highlight the variable, so if I highlight this.greeting, nothing else highlights. But if I highlight the greeting variable, it highlights the references to the local variable. So greeting plus comma space plus recipient plus exclamation mark. And then outside of the if else block, I call System.out.println of message. So it&#39;s going to print the greeting.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 13 reads: System.out.println(message);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Now I&#39;ll use Shift&#43;F10 to build and run the code and I get the greeting, Hi, Steve. Now I&#39;ll switch back to my Main.java file and change the g.sayGreeting on line 6 from Hi, Steve to empty string comma World. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The code in line 6 now reads: g.sayGreeting(&#34;&#34;, &#34;World&#34;);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />I&#39;ll save this and run the program again, which will recompile it with the changes. And I get the result Hello, World!. So in this case it used the this.greeting so we got into the first branch of the if block.</p>
<p>Because the greeting passed as an argument into sayGreeting was empty and it used the default one that belonged to the class Greet. And that concludes this demonstration of the Java this keyword.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_7" /><h2 class="section_title">8.

Your host for this session is Steve Scott.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this video, I&#39;ll describe the different types of Java comments and Java doc style commenting. Java has several different methods for commenting code. Some of the methods for adding comments are as follows. The first is block comments, added before the code they describe. Single-line comments, which are in line just before the line of code that it describes and indented to the same level. Trailing comments are short comments on the same line of code.</p>
<p>End-of-line comments are similar to trailing comments, but commented with double forward slashes by convention. And Java doc comments are specially formatted so they can be processed and used to generate separate HTML documentation. We&#39;ll have a look at each one of these in turn over the next few slides. The first example is Java block comments. In this example, I have a single line block comment with /*, then a new line, then a star and a space followed by the comment. This is a block comment.</p>
<p>Then a new line. And then /* to end the comment block. Now even though this could be put on to a single line, it leaves it open to add more lines and it emphasizes the comment, it makes it stand out. The next example we have the /*. Then with the star leading on every line. We have five lines with the leading star including an empty line, but it still has a star. So in this comment block, it makes it clear that the entire section belongs to the same comment.</p>
<p>So we have, This is a block comment with special formatting, then an empty line, then Class, Attributes, and Methods. If we have a block comment that describes a method, we show the parameters passed and we describe them and the return type and what it&#39;s returning. Java also has single-line comments, and these are indented at the same level as the code that they precede. They use /* and */ syntax, and in this example a single-line comment is added before the if statement.</p>
<p>So it says, Check if the file is loaded. Then there&#39;s, if (isLoad). And then we have the body of the if statement. And inside the if statement, the comments are indented. It is a good practice and it&#39;s conventional to leave a blank line before every single-line comment. Trailing comments appear on the same line as the code and they&#39;re usually not long. In this example, I have four trailing comments which highlight the syntax of a trailing comment.</p>
<p>So I have, boolean IsLoad; and then I have my /* declare the isLoad variable */. isLoad &#61; loadFile with filename as its argument. And then we have the comment saying, Attempt to load the file. And then if load return TRUE, and the comment says, File is loaded. else, return FALSE, File is not loaded. So trailing comments can be helpful. Although in this example I&#39;m trying to be obvious, displaying how trailing comments are formatted, but this is a bit too verbose and obvious.</p>
<p>A trailing comment can be helpful but it can also add clutter, so use it sparingly. End-of-line comments are similar to trailing comments. The syntax is a little different and double slashes are typically used. And it&#39;s often used to remove code or comment out code that should be unused or changed. So inside of the else block we have // File is not loaded // return FALSE. So this line of code was commented out and the explanation as to why it was commented out.</p>
<p>So it looks very much like the trailing comments with a different syntax. And then we have the Java doc comments. And these add specially formatted block comments to be used by a Java doc tool or processor. It contains common tags that populate the HTML documentation. So some of the common tags are, &#64;author, used to add the name of the author of the code. &#64;version for the version of the code. &#64;since specifies the date when the code, the method, or class was added.</p>
<p>&#64;deprecated can be add to indicate this class or method might no longer be used or is going to go out of use at some point in the future. We can also add an &#64;return to describe the return value of a function. And the &#64;docRoot adds a relative path to the generated comments root directory. And that concludes this presentation on Java comments.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_8" /><h2 class="section_title">9.

<p>In this video, I&#39;ll demonstrate the different types of Java comments and Java doc style comments. So in this Main.java file, I begin by declaring the package com.example. And then just before my class main is defined, the comment block I have for class main is in the doc style. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The Main.java file is open in the IntelliJ IDEA interface editor pane. It contains few lines of code.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So this style of comment begins with /**, so there&#39;s a double star. And this is the doc comment, or Java doc comment. So the generic term is doc comment, but more often than not, we&#39;re using the Java doc tools to generate documentation based on these comments. A block comment in Java is a very similar style, but the convention is /*.</p>
<p>And the nice thing about IntelliJ, it highlights the block comments in gray and the doc style comments in green. So the only difference between a Java doc style comment and a block comment is how it&#39;s opened, so /* or /**. So this first doc comment is describing our main class. So, inside of the comment, I have *Main class for this demonstration. And then each line has its own asterisk inside of this comment. We have &#64;author Steve, &#64;version 1.0, &#64;since, with the date, 2020-12-20, so year, month and day, and then I close it. And then I declare, public class Main.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 10 reads: public class Main {.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And inside the body of the Main, I have a single method, main. But before the main function is declared, I have another Java doc comment. So /**, and then *(Java), in parentheses, so (Java)Doc comment for main. So whether you call it doc comment or Java doc comment, they&#39;re used interchangeably. Then an empty *, then * and then &#64;param, describing the parameter for our function main. So the parameter name is args and the description of it goes after. So &#64;param, the name of the argument, followed by the description. And then I declare, public static void main(String[] args). And in the body of the method, I have an empty line, and then /* single line comment, */. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 reads: public static void main(String[] args) {.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />So, if you have a single line comment, always leave a space above it and then have the code begin immediately after it. So I have string str &#61; args[0]. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 20 reads: String str &#61; args[0];. /*trailing comment */.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And then I have a trailing comment, /* trailing comment */. Now if we refer to something as a trailing comment, it&#39;s usually surrounded in /* */. So it&#39;s this style of comment. Then System.out.println(str).<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 21 reads: System.out.println(str);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And then I have // to comment out System.out.println(&#34;end&#34;); //end-of-line comment. So the // is called an end of line comment. It&#39;s used to comment out lines completely or to be used interchangeably with trailing comments. So if I remove the beginning //, the end of line comment becomes trailing comment. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 23 reads: System.out.println(&#34;end&#34;);. //end-of-line comment.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And now I&#39;ll go to the Run menu, select Edit Configurations, and the argument I&#39;m going to put in is the string hello. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Various options appear, including: Run, Debug, Profile, and Attach to Process.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A dialog box titled: Run/Debug Configurations displays.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Select OK, now Shift&#43;F10 to run the code. And I get the result, Hello, and then end, which was printed at the very last line of our main method. Now we&#39;ve created these Java doc style comments, but how do we generate documentation from them? Well, if we go to the Tools menu then select Generate JavaDoc, it&#39;ll give some options about where to export the HTML files generated by these comments, by the Java Doc tool. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Various options appear, including: Tasks &amp; Contexts, Save File as Template, Manage Project Templates, and Generate JavaDoc.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A dialog box titled: Generate JavaDoc opens. It contains the following sections, including: Generate JavaDoc scope, Output directory, and Other command line arguments.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />So I&#39;m selecting the scope of it to be just the file, this main.java file. I can have it document different levels, from private package, protected, or public. So there are a number of parameters we can set for how Java doc is being used. So, Output directory, /home/steve/Documents/CommentsDemo. So I&#39;m going to create this folder, press OK. And it creates the documentation and brings me right to the Java doc.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The page titled: Generated Documentation displays. It displays a section titled: Package com.example. It contains the Class Summary, and other related details.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />And it gives me Package com.example, Class Summary, and there&#39;s a link to the main class.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>He selects the Main class link. The corresponding details appears underneath the heading: Class Main.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />And it gives me all the information, everything generated from the source. So inside, it has public class Main, extends java.lang.Object. And then the comment I put in, Main class for this demonstration, Since: 2020-12-20, Version: 1.0, Author: Steve. So this all appeared in the comment blocks inside of my code. And if I scroll down, it shows all of the generic details to do with this class, including its methods. And in this case, I have a main method, and it shows my description, (java)Doc comment for main. And if I select the method, it&#39;ll go down in the page and show me the Method Detail.</p>
<p>And it shows the Parameters, args- tag description goes here, verbatim of what I put in the source code inside of the doc comments. And that concludes this demonstration of comment styles in Java.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_9" /><h2 class="section_title">10.

<p>In this video, I&#39;ll describe Java packages and how to import them into Java application. The Java packages are used to group together related classes and are useful for avoiding naming conflicts. They&#39;re used in Java&#39;s built-in packages for comment functions such as performing I/O commands, math methods, language methods, native interface methods, etc.</p>
<p>We also have user-defined packages. These are user-created by using the package keyword at the beginning of your class file to state that the class or interface contained within belongs to it. The package statement must be the first statement in the Java class file. I&#39;ll go over some of the rules and guidelines and some examples of common Java packages. There are certain rules that you need to follow when using packages in Java class files.</p>
<p>The first rule is that the package statement must be the first statement in the Java source file. Rule two is that a single source file can only have one public class. Rule three is two source files with the same name cannot be in the same package. Rule four, if the source file does not have a package name, then it is in the default package. And rule five, if a class accesses another class, and both are in the same package, then they don&#39;t require specifying a package name to import it. There are many built-in packages available in Java.</p>
<p>Here are some of the more common ones. We have the java.applet package, containing classes for creating applets. Java.awt, or awt, contains creating graphical user interfaces with buttons and menu items. Java.io package contains classes for supporting input/output operations such as printing to the screen, a printer, or file storage system. Java.lang packages contain the classes that support the Java language such as primitive data types, string and string builder classes, and the system class.</p>
<p>Java.math contains methods for arbitrary precision floating point and integer arithmetic. Java.net contains classes for network operations. And java.util contains classes for linked lists, dictionaries, date, and time operations, and other utilities. User-defined packages can be created by using the package keyword at the start of the file. So we specify the package keyword followed by the package name, and then the class and the typical Java definitions within. In this case, I&#39;ve created a class called SamplePackageClass.</p>
<p>And because of the way it&#39;s defined, this will belong to the package samplePackage. In this case this class has no modifiers specified. So we just have class SamplePackageClass without specifying that it&#39;s public. Which makes it a private package. There are several advantages of using Java packages. Java packages are useful for grouping classes and interfaces for maintenance. Java packages help eliminate naming conflicts for classes that have the same name.</p>
<p>And it provides access protection for classes and interfaces, and along with access modifiers can add additional levels of protection. In general, it makes it easier to share and reuse code. And that concludes this presentation on Java packages.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_10" /><h2 class="section_title">11.

Your host for this session is Steve Scott.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this video, I&#39;ll demonstrate Java packages and how to import them into a Java application. So I have opened in my IntelliJ IDEA the file Document.java. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The Document.java file contains various lines of code. The left pane displays the PackagesDemo package. It lists various files, and folders.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />In the 1st line, it declares this to be package com.demo. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 1 reads: package com.demo;.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So inside of the com.demo package, we have the file Document.java with its class called Document. Looking at the Project browser inside of the source folder, src, we have com and under com, we have demo and example. So these are the two packages that are part of this PackagesDemo project. And then inside of demo, I have Document and inside of example, I have Main.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll describe the Main source file in a moment. But I&#39;ll do Document first and then I&#39;ll switch over to Main, describe that and then run the code. So inside of Document, I declared its package and then on line 3, I import java.util.Arrays, import java.util.Collections and import java.util.List.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 3 reads: import java.util.Arrays;.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 4 reads: import java.util.Collections;. Line 5 reads: import java.util.List;.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So these are three classes from the java.util package that I&#39;d like to use in my code. On line 7, I have public class Document. [Video description begins] <em>Line 7 reads: public class Document {.</em> [Video description ends] And inside of Document, I declare a single public method, public void doSomething and it takes String sentence as its parameter.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 9 reads: public void doSomething(String sentence) {.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And then inside of this, I have String[] words, so I&#39;m creating an array of strings called the words. And I set that &#61; sentence.split with the argument the string \\s.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 10 reads: String[] words &#61; sentence.split(s: &#34;\\s&#34;);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So this is going to split the string sentence on spaces and it&#39;s going to create an array of words for each word in the sentence. Then on line 11, I create a list parameterized by String. So list with String inside of angle brackets, list equals, so lowercase list &#61; Arrays.aslist words. This takes the array of words and converts it into a Java list.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 11 reads: List&lt;String&gt; list &#61; Arrays.asList(words);.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And now I use the Collections class with its static method sort.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 12 reads: Collections.sort(list);.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />And I pass in the list and it&#39;s going to create the sorted list it&#39;s going to sort the words in alphabetical or lexicographical order. And then on line 13, I call System.out.println with the string Sorted words &#43; list.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 21 reads: System.out.println(&#34;Sorted words: &#34; &#43;list);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So this is going to take the list and output the contents of it, so we can see how it performed. Now I&#39;ll switch over to my Main class inside of Main.java, which is inside the com.example package, which I declared on line 1. So I have package com.example.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 1 reads: package com.example;.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And now since the Document class is in a different package, I can&#39;t reference it directly without importing it first. So I need an import of com.demo.Document. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 3 reads: import com.demo.Document;.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />The only time I don&#39;t need this import is if Java gives it to me by default such as the java.lang package or the class belongs to the same package. So if Document was in com.example, I wouldn&#39;t need this import but since it&#39;s in a different package, I do need this and this is very important to remember. Then I have public class Main and inside of Main I have the usual main entry point public static void main String[] args.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 5 reads: public class Main {. Line 7 reads: public static void main(String[] args) {.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And inside of this, I create a document. So Document d &#61; new Document with the double parentheses to create the object. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 8 reads: Document d &#61; new Document();.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />And then I call d.doSomething with the sentence thank you for watching this video. So it&#39;s a string with spaces between each word and those should get split, sorted and displayed for us.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 10 reads: d.doSomething( sentence: &#34;thank you for watching this video&#34;);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And now I&#39;ll select Run &gt; Run Main or I could do Shift&#43;F10. And I get the result, the string Sorted words, the output of the list gives me for, thank, this, video, watching, you, the words from the sentence put into a sorted order. And that concludes this demonstration of programming with Java packages.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_11" /><h2 class="section_title">12.

Your host for this session is Steve Scott.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this video, I&#39;ll describe the features and components of the java.lang package, including the primitive wrappers, String and StringBuilder class, the math class, and the system class. The java.lang packages contain classes that support the Java language and its essential features. Wrapper classes are available for each primitive Java type. This includes boolean, byte, short, character, integer, float, long, double, and void. The String and StringBuilder class are both used to store and manipulate string data.</p>
<p>However, they&#39;re used in different situations depending on the performance characteristics needed. The math class contains static mathematical functions such as trigonometry, rounding, logarithmic, exponentiation. And the system class provides access to the JVM and its system. Java wrapper classes provide functionality to primitive data types. The automatic conversion of primitive data types into their corresponding wrapper classes is known as auto boxing. For example, from byte, lowercase byte, to byte, the uppercase.</p>
<p>So the primitive type has the lowercase char, int, long, float, boolean, double, and short. And the wrapper class has the same thing, but with an uppercase leading character. The automatic conversion of a wrapper type to its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing. So we have auto boxing and unboxing as the reverse processes of one another. The String and StringBuilder class are both used to store and manipulate string data. String is automatically created with double quotes.</p>
<p>They&#39;re pooled to save memory. They&#39;re immutable. So, once they&#39;re created they can&#39;t change, they can only be recreated or copied. Strings can be concatenated using the plus operator, but because of the immutability, this is an expensive operation. There are many methods for searching strings and manipulating strings. But in some cases, we should be using StringBuilder.</p>
<p>It&#39;s mutable so that it can be changed quickly and resized, and operations are much quicker. There are limited methods such as append, insert, delete, and replace. A string representation of the objects content can be obtained using the toString method. String buffers achieve thread safety by being synchronized across threads in a multi-threaded application. And StringBuilder is used for better performance when many operations are required to be performed on the string.</p>
<p>The math class contains static mathematical functions, such as the common trig functions like sine, cos, tangent, etc. Rounding, using round, floor, ceil, and rint. Logarithmic functions such as the base log function, or the log to base 10 function, the log 10. And exponentiation and root functions like square root, cubed root, cbrt, pow for power, and exp for exponent. And other utility functions such as absolutes or abs, minimum, maximum, random, hypotenuse, toDegrees, and toRadians, for conversions from degrees to radian measures.</p>
<p>Another construct is identifiers. Names used for methods, variables, and classes are called identifiers. Identifiers must start with either an alphabetic character, an underscore character, or the dollar sign character. And identifiers cannot be keywords and they cannot begin with a number, although they can contain numbers. Java contains both access and non-access modifiers. Access modifiers indicate which classes have access to the class, method, or variable. Non-access modifiers include final, abstract, and strict FP.</p>
<p>Final means the class cannot be inherited from. Abstract means the class cannot be instantiated into an object. And strict FP restricts floating point calculations. And variables in Java can be a local variable, a static class variable, or a non-static instance variable. And that concludes this presentation on Java basic elements.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_12" /><h2 class="section_title">13.

Your host for this session is Steve Scott.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In this video, I&#39;ll demonstrate how to use some java.lang package classes, including numeric classes, math functions and the system class. The nice thing about the java.lang package is that we don&#39;t have to write import statements for its classes. We get them by default. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The fileDemo-07-13-Main.java displays in the IntelliJ IDEA interface. The Main.java file is open in the editor pane. It contains few lines of code.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So at the beginning of this program in my Main.java on line 1, I have package com.example.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 1 reads: package com.example;.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />So as in many of these demonstrations, I leave them in this com.example package, with the package statement always coming on the 1st line. Then on line 3, I have public class Main, and in the body of Main, I have a typical main function for our entry point.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 3 reads: public class Main {.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>So on line 5, I have public static void main and in parentheses, String[] args. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 5 reads: public static void main(String[] args) {.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And then inside of this function, I declare a double d &#61; Double with an uppercase D. So we&#39;re referencing the class Double from the java.lang package, .parseDouble and I pass args at index 0. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 6 reads: double d &#61; Double.parseDouble(args[0]);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So it&#39;s going to take the first argument, try and parse it as a Double and store it in our variable d. Now the parse double function returns a primitive double, so double with the lowercase d. On line 7, I declare a Double with an uppercase D, so the actual helper class associated with the Double primitive type. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 7 reads: Double myDouble &#61; d;. /*automatic conversion - autoboxing */.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So Double called myDouble &#61; d. Now I can do a direct assignment like this and Java applies an automatic conversion and we call this autoboxing. And to test the result, I do System.out.println with the string Input: &#43; d. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 8 reads: System.out.println(&#34;input: &#34; &#43; d);.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />So it&#39;s going to print the value that&#39;s pass the numeric value. And obviously, if we pass something other than a numeric value, there&#39;ll be a number format exception when it tries to parse it. Now I have a comment saying Double with an uppercase D, so the Double class with a little arrow to lowercase double.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 13 reads: /* Double -&gt; double - unboxing */.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />So from the helper class or the wrapper class to the primitive type is called unboxing. And I do a System.out.println with the string Floor because I&#39;m going to use the Math.floor function.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 8 reads: System.out.println(&#34;Floor: &#34; &#43; Math.floor(myDouble));.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So I have a &#43; Math.floor, and I pass myDouble to it. And I do the same thing for Ceiling where I output the contents of Math.ceil c-e-i-l, and I do it on myDouble, so it&#39;s going to take the floor of it.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 9 reads: System.out.println(&#34;Ceiling: &#34; &#43; Math.ceil(myDouble));.</em> [Video description ends] </p>
<p>So it&#39;ll be the nearest integer below myDouble and the nearest integer above it. Now I&#39;m going to get the current timestamp in milliseconds and nanoseconds using the System object. So System is a special object from the java.lang package that provides some system level functions. On line 15, I have long timeMilli M-i-l-l-i &#61; System.currentTimeMillis.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 15 reads: long timeMili &#61; System.currentTimeMillis();.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So this will get the current time in milliseconds. This returns the time since the epoch from January 1st 1970. So if we need a clock time in milliseconds, we use current time Millis. It&#39;s not the most precise, however, it is accurate to the clock and it&#39;s thread safe so you&#39;ll get the same time between threads. On line 16, I have long timeNano, so I&#39;m declaring timeNano &#61; System.nanoTime. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 16 reads: long timeNano &#61; System.nanoTime();.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So the nano time method is not based on a particular clock, date or time. It&#39;s not based on the usual epoch. So you can&#39;t use it to compute a time, but it&#39;s high resolution for computing more precise time differences.</p>
<p>So you take a timestamp at one point in your code, and then you call nano time again somewhere else and you compute the difference. But in this case, nano time is not thread safe. So you can&#39;t compare time differences between different threads, only in the same thread. And then I print the contents of each. So on line 18, I have System.out.println of Current time in millis &#43; timeMilli and then System.out.println of Current time in nanoseconds &#43; timeNano. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 18 reads: System.out.println(&#34;Current time in milliseconds: &#34; &#43; timeMilli);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 19 reads: System.out.println(&#34;Current time in nanoseconds: &#34; &#43; timeNano);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Now I&#39;m going to use system to get an environment variable. So the environment variable in this case is DESKTOP_SESSION, which will return the name of the desktop environment. So I print System.out.println of System.getenv of DESKTOP_SESSION in quotes. So it&#39;s a string that I passed to it. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 22 reads: System.out.println(System.getenv(s: &#34;DESKTOP_SESSION&#34;));.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So now that I&#39;ve gone through the code, I&#39;m going to go to the Run menu &gt; Edit Configurations, where we have Build and run the parameter I&#39;m going to pass. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Various options appear, including: Run, Debug, Profile, and Attach to Process.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A dialog box titled: Run/Debug Configurations displays.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Let&#39;s pick another number, let&#39;s say 5.55, and I&#39;ll hit OK. And now, I can do a Shift&#43;F10 to run the code. So it&#39;s going to build and run and show me the results in the Run window. So I have Input is 5.55, the Floor of this is 5.0, Ceiling 6.0. I have the current time in milliseconds, which is a very long number, which is over 1.6 trillion so it&#39;s quite a long number.</p>
<p>And then the current time in nanoseconds which is over 25 trillion nanoseconds. So it&#39;s a much higher resolution but the two numbers aren&#39;t related in any way. And the nanosecond timestamp is not based on anything to do with the clock, so it doesn&#39;t resemble the time in milliseconds at all. And then finally, the desktop session in this case is mate. Even though it looks like mate, it&#39;s pronounced mate.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s the name of the desktop environment I&#39;m running in this version of Linux.
