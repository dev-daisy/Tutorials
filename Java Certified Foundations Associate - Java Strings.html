<p>One of the most basic classes in Java is the String Class. The string class is used to manage text. An individual string is really just composed of multiple individual characters. A string is not a primitive type though it is treated like an object and that means that you can create instances using the new keyword. But the most important detail about a string is that it&#39;s immutable. And that means that it can&#39;t be changed. Once it&#39;s set, that&#39;s what it is. You can create new strings and even replace the variables you&#39;re using but you can&#39;t change an existing string value.</p>
<p>In fact, behind the scenes, Java treats string values as constants, and that&#39;s why you can&#39;t change them. Now in Java, there are two ways that you can create an instance of a string. The first and frankly, the easiest is to use a literal. What that means is that you can define a string simply by saying it equals a piece of quoted text. The second way is to use the new keyword.</p>
<p>In this case, you create a new instance of the string class and pass the text you want it to be equal to. The advantage of the literal besides being easier is that Java keeps all the literals in a constants pool. So if you created two strings that had the same literal, Java would actually optimize your memory usage by having both variables point to the same memory block. So what&#39;s the syntax that we use when we&#39;re creating a string? What&#39;s the actual code that we would write to create a string and then use it?</p>
<p>Well, as I said earlier, there are two ways to do it. On the screen, we can see the code that represents those two ways. At the top of the code snippet, you see a string creation using a literal. You can declare your variable with a single String space myString, the myString text is your variable name. Then after an equal sign, you can provide the text that you want in double quotes. In the case of this code, we&#39;re saying that the myString variable is being set to the literal constants of Hello world.</p>
<p>Now remember from earlier that Java will always try to optimize your code so that if there are literals with the same text in them, they&#39;ll share the same memory location. You should use this method as much as possible because it&#39;s better for optimization and frankly, it&#39;s easier to read. The next line of code is an example of using the new keyword. This code once again creates a string variable called myString. Except this time, after the equal sign, we say new space string and then in the strings constructor, we pass in the double quoted string.</p>
<p>So remember from earlier that this will always create a new memory location for your string. It guarantees a different object in memory, but it also reduces the chance for Java to optimize your code. Strings can also be created from arrays of characters. The code on the screen here could be copied into a new Java project and it would work out of the gate. You may even want to try it. The code includes a class definition called MyString and has a single static starter method in it called main.</p>
<p>The main method would fire when the project starts up, but it&#39;s inside the main method where the magic happens. In this code, a variable called stringArray is created and it&#39;s an array of individual characters. You can see each character in single quotes to the right of the equal sign. Now if you put all the characters together, you can see that they would spell string if they were all put together. And that&#39;s what the line below does. Below the stringArray line, there&#39;s a new string variable being created called thisString.</p>
<p>After the equal sign, there&#39;s once again the new keyword to create a string, but this time, we&#39;re passing an array of characters. That&#39;s right, the string class knows how to translate characters into a string, why? Because at the end of the day, that&#39;s what strings are, arrays of characters. Then the last line of code outputs the string to the console so that it can be read. So if you ran this code, the output would be the word string.</p>
<p>Now once you have an instance of a string, you can make use of many of the different accessor methods it has. We&#39;ll talk about all the different methods later in this course. But to give you an idea, here&#39;s a couple of examples. The Length() accessor can be used to determine how many characters there are in the string. Meanwhile, the charAt() method can be used to find the individual character that exists at a given index.</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s important to understand that indexes in Java are zero based and that means that an index of zero corresponds to the very beginning of the string. So let&#39;s take a look at those string accessor methods in action. On the screen are two code snippets that show what you can do with the length and charAt methods. The top section of code creates a string variable called myString and sets it to the text Hello space world. Then in the next line of code, an integer variable is created called len. The length method is then called against the myString variable and the result of that command is placed in the len variable.</p>
<p>Now remember that the length variable simply counts all the characters in the string, and that includes the spaces and special characters. So if we count the number of characters in that string, we&#39;d get 11. So when the print line command is run after all that, that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;d get. The bottom section of the code creates a string variable called myString too. It also sets it to the text Hello space world. Then in the next line of code, a character variable is created.</p>
<p>The charAt method is then called against the myString variable with a parameter of 4, and the result of that command is placed in the char variable. Now remember that the charAt method gets the character at the given index of the string. And remember too that the index is zero based. So we&#39;re actually looking for the fifth character in the string. So if we count out the letters in Hello space world, we&#39;d see that the fifth character is the letter o.</p>
<p>So when the print line command is run after all that, that&#39;s exactly what we get. Now sometimes we need to create strings from other strings. Sometimes we need to join them together. So how do we do that if strings are immutable? Well, there are a few ways to do it. And here are a couple of the most common ways. The first way you can join strings together is to use the concat method. And this will add a single string to an existing string.</p>
<p>But it&#39;s important to note that the concat method actually generates a whole new string. It doesn&#39;t change either of the strings involved. The second way you can join strings is to use the plus character. This actually allows you to join many strings all at once. But the important thing to remember here is that each new plus symbol will result in a new string being generated in memory. So if you&#39;re planning on adding lots and lots of strings together, you may want to be careful about your memory usage. So let&#39;s take a look at a string concatenation in action.</p>
<p>On the screen are two code snippets that show the two mechanisms of concatenating strings. In the top snippet, two strings are created, the first says Hello with a space at the end and the second says world. Then the code takes the first string and calls the concat method to add the second string. Then when the code is output to the console using the print line command, we can see the output of Hello space world.</p>
<p>In the bottom snippet, the same two strings are created again, but this time, the strings are simply added together right inside the print line command. A string containing a comma and a space are added to the first string, then the second string is added. And then finally, a string containing an exclamation mark is added. In this case, you can see that we&#39;re actually adding four strings together. Now this is a very simple and common way to add strings together, but watch out, it&#39;s technically less efficient and takes more memory do it this way.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_2" /><h2 class="section_title">3.

<p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to go over the features of the string class in Java. To do that, we&#39;re going to create a project in Eclipse, and then create and display strings in a couple of ways. All right, so as I said, we&#39;re going to use the free Eclipse IDE in this demo. Now you can use any other kind of Java IDE and it&#39;ll work perfectly fine. Anyway, let&#39;s go ahead and open the Eclipse IDE now. Okay, so the first thing we&#39;re going to create is a new project. In Eclipse that&#39;s as simple as opening the File menu, and selecting New Java Project.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A dialog box labelled New Java Project opens. It contains various configuration options, including a field labelled Project name.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Now when you want to create a project you need to give it a name. And for the sake of this demo I&#39;m just going to go ahead and call my project demo1. Now strings have been around since the very beginning, so there is nothing special beyond the default settings that we need to give it. So lets just leave all the defaults as they are, and click Finish. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A dialog box labelled New module-info.java opens.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Good, now it asks us for a module name, and this isn&#39;t super important for what we&#39;re going to be doing in this course, so let&#39;s just leave that as the default2 and click Create. Perfect, now our project is created, and we&#39;re just about ready to get started with strings. Now, before we can actually code any strings, we need a file to code in. So let&#39;s go ahead and do that. Now first, let&#39;s close the module tab that we opened up in the middle of our screen.</p>
<p>All right, now in order to be able to play with a string, you first need to have an entry point into the project. So let&#39;s do that by creating a main class. From the File menu, let&#39;s select New Class.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>A dialog box labelled New Java Class opens. It contains various configuration options which include fields such as Source folder, Package, and Name.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Perfect, now in the pop up, we&#39;re being asked for information about our class. The source folder and the package are pointed to the root of our project by default, and that&#39;s fine for our purposes. Now let&#39;s give our class a name.</p>
<p>In this case, let&#39;s call it Main with a capital M. We&#39;ll leave the modifiers, superclass, and interfaces as the defaults, but let&#39;s make sure that we check the public static void main method stub check box and leave the others unchecked. Good, now let&#39;s click Finish. Excellent, we have our class. So now we can get to creating a string. Now there are three basic ways to create a string. The first way is based on what a string actually is.</p>
<p>A string is actually a collection of characters. So what we&#39;re going to do here is we&#39;re going to create an array of characters and then generate a string from that array. So let&#39;s do it. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>The following lines of code display in the Main.java file. Line 1 reads: package demo1;. Line 3 reads: public class Main {. Line 5 reads: public static void main(String[] args) {. Line 6 reads: // TODO Auto-generated method stub. Line 8 reads: }. Line 10 reads: }.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Now let&#39;s delete the comment on line 6. All right, now where the comment was, which is inside the main method, let&#39;s type the following code, char ch [] &#61; {&#39;h&#39;,&#39;e&#39;,&#39;l&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;o&#39;}; Perfect, now you can see that we have an array of characters which put together spell Hello.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s just an array of characters. Now let&#39;s create a string. To do that we go down to the line underneath our array and type the following code, String with a capital S s1 &#61; new String(ch); And I&#39;ll correct my typo. Excellent, we&#39;ve created your first string. In this example, we created an array of characters and then we created a new string object and passed in that array.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t believe me? Well, let&#39;s see it in action. Let&#39;s go down to the next line and type the following code, system with a capital S .out.println which stands for print line, (s1); Now that line of code will output our string to the console whenever we run the project. In fact, let&#39;s do that. Let&#39;s save the file with a Ctrl&#43;S, and then run the project.</p>
<p>Now we can run the project by clicking on the Run button in the toolbar. Good, now notice at the bottom of the screen that we now see the word Hello in the console, and there you go, we created a string. Now let&#39;s look at the second way that we create a string. Now notice in line 7 that we created a new string object and passed in our array of characters. Well, we can use a similar syntax, but instead of passing in an array of characters, we&#39;ll pass in a literal. Let me show you. Let&#39;s go down a couple of lines after our print line call and type the following code.</p>
<p>String again with a capital S s2 &#61; new String, again with a capital S(&#34;my&#34;); Good, now in this case we created a new string again but this time we passed in a piece of text inside double quotes. This is way easier than creating an array, isn&#39;t it? Well let&#39;s see it in action again. Let&#39;s add another print line command underneath our new string just like we did for the s1 string, except this time we&#39;ll output s2.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 11 reads: System.out.println(s2);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Good, now let&#39;s save the file and run the project. Well, excellent, perfect. Once again at the bottom of the screen we can now see the console output our first string and now our second one too. All right, now let&#39;s look at the third way that you can create a string. Now notice on line 10 that we created a new string object and passed in a piece of text in double quotes. That double quoted text is what&#39;s called a literal. It&#39;s actually already a string. So in reality, saying new string and passing in a literal is a little bit redundant.</p>
<p>We can make this even easier. So let&#39;s go down another couple of lines after our latest print line call and type the following code. String s3 &#61; &#34;friends&#34;; Good, now in this case we&#39;ve created a string variable directly from a literal. Let&#39;s see it again and type out another print line command for our new string. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 14 reads: System.out.println(s3);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Good, now let&#39;s save and run the project. Excellent, and once again, in our console, we&#39;re seeing our latest string. And there we have it. We&#39;ve created string objects in three different ways. Great job.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_3" /><h2 class="section_title">4.

Your host for this session is Sven Batalla.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In Java, strings are immutable and that means they can&#39;t be changed. To change a string means you actually need to create a new string or overwrite your existing variable. So how do you work around that? Well, Java includes a class called StringBuffer. At the end of the day, the StringBuffer class is the same as the string class, except it&#39;s mutable, which means that it can be changed. Furthermore, you can actually change the string any number of times in any number of ways.</p>
<p>You could change it so it&#39;s completely unrecognizable from the original value and that&#39;s perfectly fine. One aspect of the StringBuffer class that&#39;s important to understand is that it&#39;s thread safe. And that means that multiple threads can&#39;t access it simultaneously. And that&#39;s important because it means the operations against a StringBuffer class are guaranteed to result in order. Now unlike the string class, you can&#39;t create a StringBuffer class by just defining a string literal.</p>
<p>You must always use a constructor. In other words, you&#39;ll always have to use the new keyword. The StringBuffer class has a bunch of constructors that you can use. For example you can use the default empty constructor to simply create an instance, and then get started. And this is particularly useful ahead of looping algorithms. You can also create an instance that already has a string in it. To do that, you can use the constructor that includes a string parameter. Now, if you want to set the initial capacity of a StringBuffer instance, you can do that by calling the constructor that accepts the initial capacity value.</p>
<p>And this is useful in cases where you want to keep a close eye on how much text is being allowed in the buffer. And finally, you can pass a CharSequence value into the constructor to create a string entry from that. Now, let&#39;s take this simple code snippet to demonstrate a string buffer constructor.</p>
<p>In this code, we&#39;ve got a class called myStrBuffer with a static main method. That means that the method will execute when the project is run. In the main method, we create a variable called StrBuffer, which is a StringBuffer type. You can see because we&#39;re using the new keyword that we&#39;re creating an instance of the StringBuffer class. Now, in the brackets of the StringBuffer, we&#39;re passing in a string literal that says Hello world. And that means that we&#39;re using the string based constructor of the StringBuffer class.</p>
<p>What this code does is create an instance of the StringBuffer with an initial value of Hello World. Then in the print line command after that the values output to the console. In that case, we&#39;d see the Hello world value. Now as mentioned the StringBuffer class allows strings to be changed. In other words, the strings are immutable. To do that there are a few methods that are included in the StringBuffer class. Specifically, the append method allows us to add more text to the existing string.</p>
<p>The insert method allows us to insert text somewhere in the existing string. The replace method allows us to replace a portion of the string with some other text. The delete method allows us to remove a portion of the string. And finally, the reverse method allows us to reverse the order of the string. Now it&#39;s important to note that most of the StringBuffer class methods always use indexes to understand where to make changes in the existing string. And those indexes are always zero based. So a value of zero means the very beginning of the string.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take a look at an example of how you would use the append method. In the code snippet we see here, we&#39;re once again creating an instance of a string buffer class. In this time we&#39;re setting the default value to just Hello. Then on the next line, we call the append method to add the string space world. The result when we call the print line command at the bottom of the method is our familiar, Hello space world. Not too hard, right?</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s take a peek at an example of how you would use the insert method. In the code snippet that we see here, we&#39;re yet again creating an instance of a string buffer class. And this time we&#39;re setting the initial value to H space world. A typo, right? Well, in the next line we call the insert method to insert the string ello into that string at index 1. Now remember that indexes in Java are all 0 based. So what that means is that an index of 1 would be after the letter H.</p>
<p>In the end, when we call the print line command at the bottom of the method, we get the same old Hello world text. Next, let&#39;s take a look at an example of how you would use the replacement. In the code snippet we see here we&#39;re creating an instance of a StringBuffer class with the text, Hey there World. But now, we decided we wanted it to be our normal text. So in the line below we call the replace method to replace whatever text starts at index 0 and ends at index 9 with the text Hello. Remembering that indexes are zero based that means that the text Hey there will be replaced with Hello.</p>
<p>So if we ran this code the result from the print line method would be our usual Hello world. Now let&#39;s take a peek at an example of how you would use the delete method. In the code snippet we see here, we&#39;re creating an instance of a StringBuffer class with the text Hello there world. Once again we want to reduce the text to our usual greeting. So in the line below we call the Delete method. The delete method then removes the text from the string starting at index 6 and ending at index 11.</p>
<p>And that means it will remove the word there along with the space that follows it. Then when we call the print line command at the bottom of the method, we get the desired greeting of Hello world. And finally, let&#39;s take a look at an example of how you would use the reverse method. In the code snippet, we see here, we&#39;re creating an instance of a StringBuffer class, along with some default text. Astute observers will notice that the text is actually our usual greeting, but spelled backwards. In the line below, we call the reverse method to reorder the text back to front. Then we call the print line method at the bottom of the method and get the proper Hello world.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_4" /><h2 class="section_title">5.

<p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to go over the features of the string buffer class in Java. To do that, we&#39;re going to piggyback off our previous demo and then create an instance of a string buffer object, and then explore the methods and features available within that object. All right, so as I said, we&#39;re going to piggyback off our previous demo which we built in Eclipse. So let&#39;s head over to the Eclipse IDE now. All right, so I already have our project open from the previous demo.</p>
<p>So if you don&#39;t, go ahead and open the project now. All right, so in our last demo, we created string objects. Strings are great, and you&#39;re going to use them an awful lot in your journey into coding. But there is a problem with strings. The problem is that they&#39;re immutable, and that means that they can&#39;t be changed. You can replace the variable, sure, but you can&#39;t actually change a string. And that&#39;s where the string buffer class comes in.</p>
<p>The string buffer class manages a string in such a way that it appears to be mutable, in other words that you can change it. So what we&#39;re going to do in this demo is we&#39;re going to implement the string buffer class and go over a few of the methods and see it in action. All right, so the first thing we need to do is create an instance of a string buffer. So let&#39;s go to our main class, and we can do that by double-clicking on the Main.java file in the Package Explorer panel on the left-hand side of the screen.</p>
<p>And I&#39;ve already got mine open. All right, now in our last demo, we created some string objects, and we can still see them on the screen. So let&#39;s leave these strings there and move down a couple lines from our last print line entry. And then, let&#39;s type the following code. StringBuffer with capital S and capital B, space, buffer space, &#61; space, new space, StringBuffer(&#34;Hello&#34;) and ;. Let&#39;s make sure that Hello is capitalized. Okay, now just to see that this is working, let&#39;s add another print line command below our new buffer object and output its value. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 reads: System.out.println(buffer);.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />All right, now let&#39;s save the file and run the project. Excellent, so in our console output at the bottom of the screen, we can see that the StringBuffer behaves exactly like a string. And the value is output just like the other strings. Remember, a string is immutable. Our string buffer is supposed to help with that.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s play with the buffer a bit. Let&#39;s make our greeting a bit more personal. Rather than just saying Hello, let&#39;s add a name to the text. In the line above our print line command, but after our buffer creation, let&#39;s type out the following code, buffer.append (&#34; space, and then your name &#34;);. Okay, let&#39;s save the file and then run the project with Ctrl&#43;F11. Hey, look at that. Now our name is being output to the screen with our greeting, cool! Now, it&#39;s worth noting that you can actually chain these append commands.</p>
<p>In fact, let&#39;s go back to our append command and before the semicolon, add this code, .append (&#34;!&#34;) and ;. Now, we can save the file and run the project again. Cool, so why would we do that instead of just putting the exclamation mark in the name. Well, maybe the name was a whole other variable, so being able to append like this is a good thing. Okay, so that&#39;s appending.</p>
<p>But what if we wanted to put some text at the beginning or somewhere in the middle in the string? Well, that&#39;s where the insert method comes in. Let&#39;s try it. Let&#39;s pretend we wanted to insert a surprise exclamation at the beginning of the greeting. To do that, let&#39;s add a line of code after our append commands and before the print line command. Let&#39;s type the following, buffer.insert(0, &#34;Oh!&#34;);. Good, now as you can see, the insert method accepts two parameters.</p>
<p>The first parameter is the location in the original text to place the new text, and the second parameter is the new text to insert. The location is a zero based index in the string. So by putting 0, we&#39;re actually asking for the text to be inserted right at the beginning. Anyway, let&#39;s save this file and run the project. Hey, look at that. Now, we&#39;ve added our surprise to the beginning of the string. Now earlier, I said that you could chain the append commands together.</p>
<p>Well, the chaining is not limited to just the appending. In fact, we can delete the semi-colon from the previous line and then pull our insert command up, removing the buffer word of course. Let&#39;s do that. Good, so here we have buffer.append.append.insert. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 now reads as: buffer.append(&#34;Sven&#34;).append(&#34;!&#34;).insert(0, &#34;Oh! &#34;);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Nice, so let&#39;s save, and run it to prove it. Hey, perfect, no change to the output except for the space I just added, good job. All right, so we&#39;ve appended text to the end, and we&#39;ve inserted text at the beginning, though we could have put it anywhere.</p>
<p>But what happens if we want to replace text? Well, that&#39;s where the replace method comes in. With the replace method, we can choose a position in the text that we want to take text out and replace it with some other text. Now be careful, this isn&#39;t like a search and replace, you need to know the actual location of the text, just like the insert command. In fact, let me illustrate. Let&#39;s add a new line of code between our existing commands and our print line command.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s type buffer.replace(4, space, 9, space and then &#34;Hi&#34; and ) and ;. Cool, now in this case, we&#39;re telling the buffer that we want to replace whatever text starts at index 4 and ends at index 9, with Hi,. Actually, we&#39;re going to put a comma in there. The idea here is that we want to replace our existing Hello with something a little less formal, but also correct a little bit of grammar while we&#39;re at it. So let&#39;s save this and run it. Perfect, we&#39;ve successfully replaced Hello with Hi.</p>
<p>Now, let&#39;s shrink our code again a bit. Let&#39;s chain the replace with the two appends and the insert. And let&#39;s save and run it just to make sure it still works, and it does, good job. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 now reads as: buffer.append(&#34;Sven&#34;).append(&#34;!&#34;).insert(0, &#34;Oh! &#34;).replace(4, 9, &#34;Hi,&#34;);.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />All right, now, let&#39;s say we think that that surprise thing at the beginning is a bit goofy, and we want to remove it. Well, with the string buffer, we can also remove text. To do that, we use the delete method. So let&#39;s add to our chain of methods. After our latest replace but before the semicolon, let&#39;s add this code .delete(0, 4);. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 now reads as: buffer.append(&#34;Sven&#34;).append(&#34;!&#34;).insert(0, &#34;Oh! &#34;).replace(4, 9, &#34;Hi,&#34;).delete(0,4);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Good, now just like the insert and replace, the delete command is accepting index locations for which part of the text to remove. In our case, we&#39;re removing the O, the exclamation mark and the space that follows it. So let&#39;s save and run this. Nice, now we&#39;re just left with the hi and our name. Finally, let&#39;s play with one more method of the string buffer. Let&#39;s adjust our print line command.</p>
<p>Instead of just outputting the contents of the buffer, let&#39;s reverse the text. Let&#39;s add the following code after the buffer variable, but still inside the brackets .reverse(). <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 18 reads: System.out.println(buffer.reverse());.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Good, now all this is doing is taking the contents of the buffer and reversing the order. So let&#39;s save it and run it. Perfect, now our string has been reversed and there&#39;s not much left of our original &#34;Hello&#34; is there? And that&#39;s it, that&#39;s the string buffer. With that class, you can create and manipulate strings to your heart&#39;s content.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_5" /><h2 class="section_title">6.

<p>In Java, strings are immutable, and that means that they can&#39;t be changed. To change a string means you need to actually create a new string or overwrite your existing variable. So how do you work around that? Well, earlier we saw that we could use the StringBuffer class. But there&#39;s another option too. You can also use the StringBuilder class. One big difference between the StringBuilder and StringBuffer classes is that the Builder class is much more efficient.</p>
<p>However, it isn&#39;t thread safe. That means that multiple threads can access it simultaneously, but in those situations, you would not be able to guarantee the order of operations. But like the StringBuffer class, you can use the StringBuilder class to change a string, any number of times. And that&#39;s because at the end of the day, the StringBuilder class is the same as the String class, except it&#39;s mutable. Which means that it can be changed.</p>
<p>Now, unlike the String class, you can&#39;t create a StringBuilder class by just defining a string literal. You must always use a constructor. In other words, you&#39;ll always have to use the new keyword. The StringBuilder class has a bunch of constructors that you can use. For example, you can use the default empty constructor to simply create an instance and then get started. And again, this is pretty useful when you&#39;re doing looping algorithms. You can also create an instance that already has a string in it.</p>
<p>To do that, you can use the constructor that includes a string parameter. Now if you want to set the initial capacity of a StringBuilder instance, you can do that by calling the constructor that accepts the initial capacity value. And this is useful in cases where you want to keep a close eye on how much text is being allowed into the builder. And finally, you can pass a CharSequence value into the constructor to create a string entry from that. Now let&#39;s take this simple code snippet to demonstrate a StringBuilder constructor.</p>
<p>In this code, we&#39;ve got a class called StringBuilderCreation with a static main method. That means that this method will execute when the project is run. In the main method, we create a variable called mySb which is a StringBuilder type. You can see because we&#39;re using the new keyword that we&#39;re creating an instance of the StringBuilder class. In the brackets of the StringBuilder, we&#39;re passing in a string literal that says &#34;Hello world&#34;.</p>
<p>And that means that we&#39;re using the string based constructor of the StringBuilder class. What this code does is create an instance of the StringBuilder with an initial value of Hello world. Then in the print line command after that, the value is output to the console. And in that case, we&#39;d see the Hello world value. As mentioned, the StringBuilder class allows strings to be changed. In other words, the strings are mutable.</p>
<p>To do that, there are a few methods that are included in the StringBuilder class. Specifically, the append method allows us to add more text to the existing string. The insert method allows us to insert text somewhere in the existing string. The replace method allows us to replace a portion of the string with some other text. And finally, the delete method allows us to remove a portion of the string.</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s important to note that most of the StringBuilder class methods use indexes to understand where to make changes in the existing string. And those indexes are always zero based. So a value of zero means the very beginning of the string. Now let&#39;s take a look at an example of how you would use the append method. In the code snippet we see here, we&#39;re once again creating an instance of a StringBuilder class. This time we&#39;re setting the default value to just &#34;Hello&#34;. Then on the next line, we call the append method to add the string &#34; world&#34;.</p>
<p>The result when we call the print line command at the bottom of the method is our familiar Hello world, pretty easy. Now let&#39;s take a peek at an example of how you&#39;d use the insert method. In the code snippet we see here, we&#39;re yet again creating an instance of a StringBuilder class. And this time we&#39;re setting the initial value to ello world. Missing the H, sounds very British of us, ello Guv. Anyway, on the next line we call the insert method to insert the string H into that string at index 0. Now remember that index is in Java are all zero based.</p>
<p>So that means that an index of 0 would be right at the beginning of the string. So in the end when we call the println command at the bottom method, we&#39;re getting the same old Hello world text. Next, let&#39;s take a look at an example of how you would use the replace method. In the code snippet we see here, we&#39;re creating an instance of a StringBuilder class with the text, &#34;Hey there world&#34;. But now we decided we want it to be our normal greeting text.</p>
<p>So in the line below, we call the replace method to replace whatever text starts at index 0 and ends at index 9 with the text Hello. And again, remembering that indexes are zero based, that means that the text, Hey there, will be replaced with Hello. So if we ran this code, the result from the println command will be our usual Hello world. Finally, let&#39;s take a peek at an example of how you would use the delete method. In the code snippet we see here, we&#39;re creating an instance of a StringBuilder class with the text, &#34;Hello there world&#34; again.</p>
<p>And once again, we want to reduce this text to our usual greeting. So in the line below, we call the delete method. The delete method then removes the text from the string that starts at index 6, and ends at index 11. And that means it will remove the word there, along with the space that follows it. Then, when we call the println method at the bottom of the method, we get the desired greeting of Hello world.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_6" /><h2 class="section_title">7.

<p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to go over the features of the StringBuilder class in Java. To do that, we&#39;re going to piggyback off our previous demo and create an instance of a StringBuilder object, and then explore the methods and features available within that object. All right, so as I said, we&#39;re going to piggyback off our previous demo which we built in Eclipse. So let&#39;s head over to the Eclipse IDE now. All right, so I already have our project open from the previous demo, but if you don&#39;t, go ahead and open the project now.</p>
<p>Okay, so in our last demo, we used a StringBuffer object to manipulate strings. That&#39;s because strings are immutable, which means they can&#39;t be changed. In this demo, we&#39;re going to use the StringBuilder class to manipulate strings. StringBuilder and StringBuffer are very similar classes. There are two main differences between them. The first is that StringBuffer is thread safe, whereas StringBuilder is not.</p>
<p>And what that means is that a single StringBuilder instance can be called by multiple threads simultaneously, whereas StringBuffer can&#39;t. And StringBuilder is also much more efficient. Anyway, let&#39;s give it a try. All right, so the first thing we need to do is create an instance of a StringBuilder. So let&#39;s go to our main class, and we can do that by double clicking on the Main.java file in the Package Explorer panel on the left hand side of the screen and mine&#39;s already open, good.</p>
<p>Now in our last demo, we created a StringBuffer object. And we&#39;re going to leave all that and the other strings alone and move down a couple lines from our last println entry. Then let&#39;s type the following code, StringBuilder with a capital s and b, builder &#61; new StringBuilder(&#34;Hello&#34;);. Good, now notice that this looks exactly like the StringBuffer command that we used earlier. And that&#39;s no coincidence. Now, just to see that this is working, let&#39;s add another print line command below our new builder object, and output its value. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 21 reads: System.out.println(builder);.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Good, now let&#39;s save the file and run the project with a Ctrl&#43;F11. Hey, look at that, excellent. In our console output at the bottom of the screen, we can see that the StringBuilder behaves exactly like our string and buffer objects, and the value is output just as expected. Now, just like our StringBuffer object, the StringBuilder is supposed to help us with manipulating otherwise immutable strings. So let&#39;s play with the builder like we did with the buffer. Let&#39;s make our greeting a bit more personal again.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s add our name to the text. So in the line above our latest println command, but below the builder creation, let&#39;s type out this code, builder.append(&#34; Sven&#34;);. Good, now let&#39;s save the file and run the project. Hey, look at that. Now our name is being output to the screen with our greeting. Cool, now it&#39;s worth noting that just like with StringBuffer, you can actually chain commands. In fact, let&#39;s go back to our append command. And before the semicolon, add this code, .append(&#34;!&#34;).<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 21 now reads as: builder.append(&#34;Sven&#34;).append(&#34;!&#34;);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And now we can save the file and run the project again. Cool, so now we know that the builder works just like the buffer, nice. All right, now that&#39;s appending. But what if we wanted to put some text at the beginning, or somewhere in the middle of the string? Well, just like with the StringBuffer class, the StringBuilder class also has an insert method.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s try it. Let&#39;s pretend we wanted to insert our surprised exclamation at the beginning of the greeting. So to do that, let&#39;s chain another command to the end of our builder command. So before the semicolon, type the following .insert(0, &#34;Oh!&#34;) and then we&#39;ll leave the semi-colon.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 21 now reads as: builder.append(&#34;Sven&#34;).append(&#34;!&#34;).insert(0, &#34;Oh! &#34;);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />As you see, just like with the StringBuffer class, the insert method accepts two parameters. The first parameter is the zero-based index of where to put the new text, and the second parameter is the new text insert. Now, it&#39;s important to remember that the index is zero-based. So by putting 0 in our command, we&#39;re actually asking for our new text to be inserted right at the beginning. Anyways, let&#39;s save the file and run the project. Hey, excellent. Now we&#39;ve added our surprise to the beginning of the string, nice job. All right, so we&#39;ve appended text to the end, and we&#39;ve inserted text at the beginning, though we could have put it anywhere.</p>
<p>But what happens if we want to replace text? Well, StringBuilder has this covered there, too. And just like StringBuffer, the replace method can be used to choose a portion of the text that we want to replace with some other text. Now, be careful though. Just like StringBuffer, this isn&#39;t like a search and replace. You need to know the actual location of the text, just like the insert command. In fact, let&#39;s add another command to our chain of commands. Before the semicolon, let&#39;s type .replace(4, 9, &#34;Hi,&#34;). <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 21 now reads as: builder.append(&#34;Sven&#34;).append(&#34;!&#34;).insert(0, &#34;Oh! &#34;).replace(4, 9, &#34;Hi,&#34;);.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Good, now in this case, we&#39;re telling the buffer that we want to replace whatever text starts at index 4, and ends at index 9 with Hi,. Now, we&#39;ve once again decided that we want to replace our existing hello with something a little less formal, but also correct a bit of grammar. So let&#39;s save this and run this. Perfect, we&#39;ve successfully replaced Hello with Hi. Nice job. All right, now let&#39;s say, once again, we feel that our surprise thing at the beginning is goofy, and we want to remove it.</p>
<p>Well, with StringBuilder, we can remove text just like we did with StringBuffer. So let&#39;s do that. We&#39;ll use the delete command to do that. So let&#39;s add to our chain of commands. Now, after our latest replace, but again, before the semicolon, let&#39;s add this code .delete(0, 4). <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 21 now reads as: builder.append(&#34;Sven&#34;).append(&#34;!&#34;).insert(0, &#34;Oh! &#34;).replace(4, 9, &#34;Hi,&#34;).delete(0,4);.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Good, now just like the insert and replace, the delete command is accepting index locations for which part of the text to remove. Now in our case, we&#39;re removing the oh, the exclamation mark, and the space that follows it.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s save this and run it. Nice, now we&#39;re just left with the Hi and our name. Now finally, let&#39;s play with one more method in the StringBuilder. Let&#39;s adjust our print line command, just like we did with the StringBuffer. Instead of just outputting the contents of the builder, let&#39;s reverse the text. So let&#39;s add the following code after the builder variable, but still inside the brackets, .reverse(). <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 22 reads: System.out.println(builder.reverse());.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Good, and now let&#39;s save it and run it. Perfect, now our string has been reversed, just like it was with the buffer. Now there&#39;s not much left of our original hello again, is there? And so that&#39;s it, that&#39;s the StringBuilder. With that class, you can create and manipulate strings to your heart&#39;s content, just like you did with StringBuffer. Now, StringBuilder is more efficient, but it isn&#39;t thread safe, so choose whichever one works best for you.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_7" /><h2 class="section_title">8.

Your host for this session is Sven Batalla.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>The String class in Java has quite a number of built in methods that can be used to obtain information or new strings all together from a given string. As an example, here are a few common methods that are used against a string, charAT, length, toUpperCase, toLowercase, substring. There&#39;s a couple different kinds, trim, indexOf, lastindexOf, concat, and more. In fact, let&#39;s dig into these a little bit. Let&#39;s take a look at a small code snippet and see the charAt method in action. In the code snippet we have here, we create an instance of a string with the text Hello world. Then in the line below, we call the charAt method on the string and asked for the character at index zero. Purpose of the charAt method is to return whatever character is at a given index.</p>
<p>Now, remember that indexes are all zero based. So that means that index zero means the very first character in the string. So in this case, that would be the letter H in Hello world. That value is put into a character variable called ch and then print it to the console in the print line command at the bottom of the method. If we ran this code, it would output the letter H. Next, let&#39;s look at an example code snippet that shows how we would use the length method. In this code snippet, we create an instance of a string with the text Hello world. Then in the line below, we call the length method on that string, while outputting the result to the console using the print line command. The purpose of the length method is to return the total number of characters, including spaces and special characters in the string.</p>
<p>Now if you manually counted the number of characters in the string, Hello space world, you would arrive at 11 characters. So if we can this code, that&#39;s the result that we would get in Yelp. Now let&#39;s take a look at another small code snippet and see the toUpperCase method in action. In the code snippet we have here we yet again create an instance of a string with our familiar text Hello world. Then in the line below, we call the toUpperCase method on that string. Now the purpose of the toUpperCase method is to simply take a string and output a capitalized version of that string. So when we use it in the print line command, as has been done here, it means that the output of this code would be the text Hello world, but in all uppercase letters.</p>
<p>Now if the toUpperCase method creates a version of a string that is all uppercase, guess what the toLowerCase method does? That&#39;s right, it makes the text lowercase. So let&#39;s take a peek at a code snippet for that method.</p>
<p>As you can see, the code is exactly identical to our last snippet that we used for the toUpperCase method. The difference here is that we just call the toLowerCase method. That means that the result this method would be to take our usual Hello world greeting and output the same text but all in lowercase. One of the more interesting methods in the string class is the substring method. In this code snippet, we&#39;re using the version of the method that takes only one parameter. We once again create a simple string with the text Hello space world.</p>
<p>Then we call the substring method against that string with a single parameter that has a value of 6. The purpose of the substring method is to retrieve a portion of a given string and output a new string. Remember that indexes are zero based. So that means that the substring method is going to return the entire string starting at the seven letter.</p>
<p>In this case, the seventh letter is the beginning of the word world. Since this version of the sub string method takes everything from there, it means that this code would return the word world. But then there&#39;s the other version of the substring method, you can pass two parameters into that method. The first parameter would be the starting index and the second parameter would be the ending index, then the substring method would return the text in that range.</p>
<p>In this example, we call the substring method against a Hello world string and asked for whatever it is in the range from 0 to 5, and that would return the word hello. If we wanted the word world, we would use the range 6 to 11. Now let&#39;s take a look at an example of how you would use the trim method. In this code snippet, we&#39;ve created the string Hello world, but then we added a bunch of spaces at the beginning and again at the end.</p>
<p>The purpose of the trim method is to remove spaces from the beginning and end of any string. So in the next line we call the trim method and the output of that call is a new string but with no spaces at the beginning and end. Now it&#39;s important to understand that the trim only works on the beginning and end, it doesn&#39;t touch any of the spaces inside the text. So the space between hello and world is saved. In the end, this code would output our usual greeting of Hello world. Next, let&#39;s take a look at an example of how you would use the index of method.</p>
<p>In this code snippet, we&#39;ve yet again created the string Hello world. In the next line we call the indexOf method against a string and pass in the character w. The purpose of the indexOf method is to find where in the string a certain piece of text starts. In this case, we&#39;re looking for the letter w anywhere in the string. Actually, that&#39;s important. Here I&#39;m looking for a single character, but I could just as easily look for an entire word.</p>
<p>If we ran this code, the output would be 6. Now remember that all indexes are zero based. So index 6 is actually the set of characters. So that&#39;s right. So what happens if the text isn&#39;t found? What if we had the letter q in there? Well, if the text isn&#39;t found, the indexOf method would return a value of -1. Now another thing you need to remember is that the indexOf method returns the first instance of a piece of text.</p>
<p>So if we put the letter o in this code, the indexOf method would have returned the index 4 even though there&#39;s another o at index 7. Now that brings us to the next example quite nicely. What if we wanted the other o in the text? Well, another option would be to look for the last instance of a piece of text in a given string. The method lastIndexOf does exactly that. In this code snippet, we use the lastIndexOf method to look for the last occurrence of the letter O in the string Hello world, and the answer is then 7.</p>
<p>Now the indexOf method does support being given a starting index. So if you wanted to find all instances of a certain piece of text in a string, you can create a loop that searched for that text until the result was -1. At each iteration of the loop, you would set the starting index to the last found instance of the text plus one. Finally, let&#39;s take a look at the example of the concat method.</p>
<p>In this code snippet, we&#39;ve created a string called myString with the text Hello. Then in the next line we call the concat method with the text space world. The purpose of the concat method is to take an existing string and add the given text to it output a new combined string. Strings are immutable, which means that they can&#39;t change. So the concat method has to output a new string. But this code tries to be clever and actually replaces our original string variable with the new value anyway. Then in the end, when the code is run, the output from the print line command is our usual Hello world.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_8" /><h2 class="section_title">9.

<p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to go over the various methods associated with the String class in Java. Even though the String class is immutable, meaning it can&#39;t change, it doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t have a whole load of useful features. In this demo, we&#39;ll piggyback off our last few demos and go over some of the methods associated with a String and output the results to the console. All right, so as I said, we&#39;re going to piggyback off our previous demos which we built in Eclipse. So let&#39;s head over to the Eclipse IDE now. All right, so I already have our project open from the previous demo and if you don&#39;t, go ahead and open the project now. Okay, so in our last demos, we created a few strings, implemented a StringBuffer and implemented a StringBuilder.</p>
<p>Strings are immutable. So our Buffer and Builder classes were used to show how to manipulate strings. But you saw that those classes really didn&#39;t have much more than manipulation features. Well, that&#39;s because the string object itself already has quite a few useful methods in it. In this demo, we&#39;re going to look at a few of those methods. All right, so the first thing we need to do is access an existing string instance.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s go to our main class. We can do that by double-clicking on the Main.java file in the Package Explorer panel on the left-hand side of the screen. But I&#39;ve already got mine open. Good, now in our first demo, we created three strings. What we&#39;re going to do in this demo is explore some of the features of those strings. There are quite a lot of methods and in the interest of time, I won&#39;t go over all of them, but I will go over some of the most common and important ones. So let&#39;s start with the join method. Actually before we do, it&#39;s worth understanding that there are some static methods that you can access on the string class.</p>
<p>And then some methods that you can access on instances of a string. The join method is a static class. In fact, let me just show you. Below our s3 friends string, and its print line command, let&#39;s move down a couple of lines and type the following code. String s4 &#61;String.join(&#34; &#34;, s1, s2, s3);.</p>
<p>Now the join command joins any number of strings together, and delimiter can be provided too. In this case, I&#39;ve set the delimiter as a space. So all three of those strings will be joined together and separated by a space. Now, let&#39;s add a print line command for s4 and then let&#39;s save and run it.</p>
<p>And remember the run command is Ctrl&#43;F11.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 reads: System.out.println(s4);.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Excellent, now we can see in the console output at the bottom of the screen that all of our strings have been joined together. Hello my friends, nice. The next method we want to look at is the length method. This method is an instance method, meaning it needs an instance of a string to work, and it tells us how long our string is. Now that might seem unimportant. But you may also remember from our StringBuilder and StringBuffer classes that we provided indexes for where to insert, replace, and even delete characters.</p>
<p>Well, if you try to provide an index that&#39;s outside the size of the string, it will fail. So knowing the length can be very crucial. So let&#39;s see it in action. Let&#39;s adjust our s4 print line command. Let&#39;s append .length().<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 now reads: System.out.println(s4.length());</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Now if we count the number of characters in the sentence hello my friends, we&#39;ll see there are 16 characters, if we include the spaces. So let&#39;s save this file and run the project and see what it tells us. And look at that, the hello my friends was replaced with 16.</p>
<p>Another common method is substring. Substring is used to extract a portion of the string based on given indexes. So let&#39;s say we wanted to extract the word friends from the sentence that we have in the s4 variable.</p>
<p>To do that, we&#39;d need to know the starting and ending index for that word. If we count out the characters in the sentence and remember that everything is zero-based, we know that the word friends starts at index 9 and ends at index 16. So let&#39;s replace the length method in the s4 print line command with substring(9, 16). Good, now let&#39;s save and run it. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 now reads: System.out.println(s4.substring(9, 16));.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Excellent, we got the word friends. Now notice that, in this case, the end index actually happens to be the end of the string.</p>
<p>Well, if that&#39;s the case, then there&#39;s a shortcut that you can take. There&#39;s another version of the substring method that you can use, where you can just provide the start index. And then it will take the rest of the string from there. So let&#39;s remove the comma space 16 from the substring command and save the file and run it again. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 now reads: System.out.println(s4.substring(9 ));.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And look at that, the exact same output, nice. Next comes the contains method. Now, contains tells us whether some text exists within our string. And let&#39;s try it out.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s replace our substring command with .contains(&#34;ie&#34;). Now we know that the text ie exists in our string. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 now reads: System.out.println(s4.contains(&#34;ie&#34; ));.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />It&#39;s right in the middle of the word friends. So we should expect a positive result. So let&#39;s save it and run it. Good, it returned true. But one thing you need to remember about strings is that they&#39;re case sensitive. So let&#39;s make that ie text that we&#39;re looking for capitalized and try it again. See, this time it&#39;s false. And that brings us to our next handy method. There&#39;s actually two. The toLowerCase and toUpperCase methods can convert the strings to, well, upper and lowercase.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s use one of them. Now before the dot in our contains command, let&#39;s add this code. .toUpperCase with a capital U and a capital C, open and close brackets.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 now reads: System.out.println(s4.toUpperCase().contains(&#34;IE&#34; ));.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Now what this will do is it will take our string, convert it to uppercase and then see if the text IE is found in there. So let&#39;s save and run this. It&#39;s true again, the text is found. Now remember in the StringBuffer and StringBuilder demos that we had to replace text by knowing their indexes? Well, with string methods, we don&#39;t have to. We can replace text directly.</p>
<p>The important difference is that this results in a whole new string being created, not a manipulation of the existing string. So let&#39;s replace our toUppercase and contains command with the following, .replace(&#34;hello&#34;, &#34;howdy&#34;). <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 now reads: System.out.println(s4.replace(&#34;hello&#34;, &#34;howdy&#34; ));.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />So this will replace our existing hello with the goofy howdy instead. Or at least it should. Let&#39;s save and run it to find out. Hey, it worked. Now another method of the string class is the equals method. And this is for when you want to compare two strings to each other. Of course, you can just use the equal sign operator and that would work just as well. However, there&#39;s a variation of the equals method that&#39;s even better, and that&#39;s the equalsIgnoreCase. As you can guess from the name, the method allows us to compare two strings to see if they&#39;re the same, regardless of what case they may be.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s replace our replace method with .equalsIgnoreCase, with a capital I and a capital C, open bracket, double quote. And then in various upper and lowercase, Hello, my Friends&#34;).<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 now reads: System.out.println(s4.equalsIgnoreCase(&#34;Hello my friends&#34; ));.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Good, so we can see plainly that with different case the text doesn&#39;t equal, but since we&#39;re using the special method they should be equal. So let&#39;s execute this and find out.</p>
<p>Hey, true, perfect, equal just like we hoped. Now finally, let&#39;s look at one last method. The indexOf method is very important. Remember all those methods that we&#39;ve used so far that all require an index? Well, what if you don&#39;t exactly know where that text is? The user types a string and you have no idea where any given piece of text is, or if it&#39;s even there.</p>
<p>Well, that&#39;s where the indexOf method comes in. Let&#39;s try it out. Let&#39;s replace our equals method with this, .indexOf with a capital O, (&#34;my&#34;).<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 17 now reads: System.out.println(s4.indexOf(&#34;my&#34; ));.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Now this will look for the text my, and return where in the string it finds it. Now let&#39;s save the file and run the project to see. Excellent, we see that it&#39;s at index 6, but what happens if it&#39;s not found? Well, let&#39;s change the text to uppercase. And now let&#39;s save and run it again to see.</p>
<p>This time we see a value of -1, and that means that the text was not found. Now there are various flavors of the indexOf method and each is built for different variations of being able to find text. So you need to look at the documentation to decide which is best for your situations. But that&#39;s the string methods in a nutshell, and there are lots more, like isEmpty, concat, split, intern, trim, and valueOf. Some methods even have multiple overloads.</p>
<p>So it&#39;s worth reading over each of them. Anyway, great job.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_9" /><h2 class="section_title">10. Video: Java Escaping Characters ( it_sdjcfa_09_enus_10)</h2><img src="https://cdn2.percipio.com/public/b/86447954-987a-4409-9f5e-db4c004fde30/image001.jpg" alt="" width="300" onclick="(()=>document.getElementById('lb-image').src = 'https://cdn2.percipio.com/public/b/86447954-987a-4409-9f5e-db4c004fde30/image001.jpg')();" /><div class="section_text"></div><h3 class="list_title">Objectives</h3><ul class="list"><li class="list_item">describe the various String escaping characters</li></ul><div class="section inner"><div class="section_text">[Video description begins] <em>Topic title: Java Escaping Characters. Your host for this session is Sven Batalla.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>Like most programming languages, Java string implementation includes the ability to use escape characters. But what is that, and when would you use it? Well, first you need to understand that when you use strings in Java, you will inevitably run across the need to use special characters. And that includes embedding quotes, adding tabs and carriage returns, or even including fancy Unicode text. Much of those values can&#39;t just be typed into a string because, well, you just can&#39;t. So how do you put a double quote in a string that is defined by double quotes?</p>
<p>Well, for that you need to use escape characters. In Java, the escape character is the backslash. Any special character that you want to put into a string will always be prefixed by the backslash, even the backslash. Let&#39;s take a look at a very simple example of the use of escape characters in Java strings. In the code snippet we see on the screen, we create a string with the text, She smiled and said, &#34;hello&#34;. Now, in any book you read, you&#39;d see the text hello in quotes, because that&#39;s what the person said.</p>
<p>In this text, we see the same thing except the quotes have a backslash in front. And the reason for that is because the quotes are special characters. If they didn&#39;t have the backslash, they would appear to the Java compiler to be the end of the string, and that&#39;s not right, so they have to be escaped. Anyway, when the code is run and output to the console using the print line command, the result would be, She smiled and said &#34;hello.&#34;. with the word hello, in quotes. Now if the backslash is a special escape character, then what happens if we want to actually see backslashes in the text?</p>
<p>Well, the simple answer is that you would put a backslash before the backslash. In this code snippet, we want to output a directory location to the screen. Specifically, we&#39;re creating a string that says, The file is in C:\\Documents\\files. You&#39;ll see in that text that the backslashes are all doubled. And that means that Java will allow the backslash to be output to the string. So if we ran this code, the output of the print line command would be exactly what we expect, and the double backslashes would be output as a single backslash.</p>
<p>Now, another thing about the backslash is that it can be used to denote special characters. A backslash before a certain character can be used to represent a piece of text that you can&#39;t otherwise actually type. Java supports the following special characters. \t means tab, \b means backspace, but it&#39;s worth noting that it&#39;s usually something that&#39;s captured from input text versus something that&#39;s actually presented in a string. \n means new line, \r means carriage return, \&#39; puts a single quote in a string, but it&#39;s not usually required, though. And you&#39;ve seen the \&#34; in action already, and the \f means form feed. But just like backspace, it&#39;s usually captured versus actually being presented in a string.</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s take a look at an example of how you might use one of these special characters. In the code snippet here, we&#39;re using a few of the backslash characters. Here we&#39;ve created a string that once again says, The file is in &#34;C:\Documents\files.&#34;. But this time, we&#39;ve put the location in quotes and we&#39;ve used a special character \n to put the location on its own line. So if we ran this code the result would be the text The file is in, and then the location &#34;C:\Documents\files.&#34; would be in quotes and on the next line. Now, another thing you can do with backslashes is insert special Unicode characters into your string. Some text can&#39;t be typed on your keyboard. Think of a mathematical symbol, bullets, ASCII bounding boxes and so on. All characters have a Unicode value.</p>
<p>So by using the special string \u and then the Unicode value, you can insert Unicode text into your string. As an example, this table shows that the Unicode value for the copyright symbol is 00A9, and the greater than or equal to Unicode value is 2265. So how would you use the Unicode values in a string? Well, like I said, you would use the string \u and then the Unicode value. To illustrate, consider this code snippet.</p>
<p>In this snippet we&#39;re creating a string that says, (&#34;Copyright \u00A9 2021.&#34;); Then when the string is output to the console using the println command at the bottom of the code, the \u00A9 is replaced with the copyright symbol. So the output is actually Copyright, copyright symbol, 2021. You can use Unicode characters for all kinds of things. One interesting example is to output Chinese characters. Now, I use this all the time for bullet points and checkmarks.</p>
<p>Unicode characters are readily available on the Internet for you to browse and use.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_10" /><h2 class="section_title">11.

<p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to go over the various string escaping mechanisms associated with the string class in Java. Sometimes, strings have special characters in them that interfere with code. And so those characters need to be dealt with, and that&#39;s escaping. All right, so in this demo, we&#39;re going to piggyback off our previous demos which we built in Eclipse. So let&#39;s head over to the Eclipse IDE now. All right, so I already have our project open from the previous demo. And if you don&#39;t, go ahead and open that project now. Okay, so in our last demos, we created a few strings, implemented a string buffer, and implemented a string builder. Then we explored the various features of the string class itself.</p>
<p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to create another string, and this time look to escape some special characters. All right, so the first thing we need to do is create a string instance. So let&#39;s go to our Main class. We can do that by double-clicking on the Main.java file in the Package Explorer panel on the left-hand side of the screen, but I already have mine open. Now at the bottom of the Main method, let&#39;s create a new string. Let&#39;s go a couple of lines down and type the following. String s5 &#61; &#34;Die Hard is a Christmas movie&#34;; And now let&#39;s add a print line command below that.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 28 reads: System.out.println(s5);.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Good, and now let&#39;s save and run the project so that we can see where we&#39;re at. And remember, to run the project, it&#39;s Ctrl&#43;F11. Good, so far so good, right? Well, what if we wanted to put the movie title in quotes? Well, let&#39;s do it. Let&#39;s put double quotes around the movie title. Notice how right away there are errors, Java does not like this. Basically, according to the compiler, it looks like we have an empty string, followed by two commands, Die and Hard, followed by another string and none of it with any sort of operators.</p>
<p>So it&#39;s very confused. So how do we fix that? Well, that&#39;s where escaping comes in. If we want to use a key character like a double quote in a string, we have to escape it. The escape character in Java is the backslash. So let&#39;s see what happens when we put a backslash in front of the quotes that we want in the string. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 27 now reads: String s5 &#61; &#34;\&#34;Die Hard \&#34; is a Christmas movie&#34;;.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Much better, let&#39;s save and run this to see if it works. Perfect, now the quotes are accepted in the string. But you may have noticed an interesting flaw.</p>
<p>What if the character we want in the string is the escape character? What if we actually want a backslash in our string? Well, let&#39;s replace our text with something else to demonstrate. Let&#39;s replace the text with, My temp folder is c:\temp. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 27 now reads: String s5 &#61; &#34;My temp folder is c:\temp&#34;;.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />And now let&#39;s run this to see what happens. Now, there are two things worth noting in the output. First, is that the backslash doesn&#39;t appear, but neither did the t in the folder name temp. We&#39;ll get to that part in a second.</p>
<p>The main thing we want to deal with here is showing our backslash. Well, to do that, we just add another backslash in front of it. So let&#39;s do that and rerun. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 27 now reads: String s5 &#61; &#34;My temp folder is c:\\temp&#34;;.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Perfect, now we can see the backslash. So now we can ask the question, well, why did the t not show up when we ran this last time? Well, you may have noticed that there was a big space instead.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s because the escape character can also be used to input other special characters. So the \t actually means tab, and that&#39;s what we saw. In fact, there are a few special characters like that. Let&#39;s see if we can use a whole bunch of them. Let&#39;s replace the text with this. &#34;Hello, \r\n\n My name\&#39;s Sven.&#34; I like: \r\n\t-Movie: space \&#34;Die hard\&#34;\r\n\t-Hobby: Programming. Now, in this text, we used the \r for carriage return, the \n for line feed, the \t for tab, the \&#39; for single quote, and the \&#34; for double quote.</p>
<p>Now missing from the string is the \b for backspace and the \f for form feed, but those don&#39;t render in strings and are usually used more for commands. So let&#39;s run the code and see what it shows us. Excellent, so we see the new line commands, the quotes and the tabs, nice. Now, there are also ways to escape unicode characters. So it doesn&#39;t just have to be line feeds, quotes, and backslashes. Imagine you wanted to replace our dashes in the string we just wrote with a bullet symbol. Well, you could do that. In fact, let&#39;s do that right now. Let&#39;s replace the dashes with \u2022. And I&#39;m going to clean up some spaces while I&#39;m at it.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 27 now reads: String s5 &#61; &#34;Hello, \r\n\nMy name\&#39;s Sven. I like:\r\n\t\u2022Movie: \&#34;Die hard\&#34;\r\n\t\u2022Hobby: Programming&#34;;.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Now, let&#39;s run this and see what we get. Hey, excellent, so you can see that the unicode character that corresponds with that code was output to the screen and it&#39;s a bullet mark.</p>
<p>Now that&#39;s cool. Now, there are tons of unicode characters. So you can do quite a lot with that capability. In fact, you can use it to output various kinds of symbols, letters with accents, or even different languages like Chinese. So that&#39;s escaping in Java in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Not much to it, right? Great job.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_11" /><h2 class="section_title">12.

<p>When we&#39;re using strings in Java, there&#39;s lots of situations where we&#39;ll want to include values in a string and we&#39;re going to want them to be formatted a certain way. For example, imagine you wanted to create a method that created entries in a log file, or output those values to the console. Now imagine you wanted that method to include a timestamp in it. Well, you probably want that timestamp to be formatted in a particular way, right? Well, that&#39;s where Java&#39;s formatting classes and methods come in. As you insert values into a string, the way to do it is with format specifiers. Format specifiers exist to aid with the display of values in just about every data type. This includes strings, integers, dates, doubles, and so on. Format specifiers always start with the percent symbol. Formatters don&#39;t just output values to a string either, they can actually be used to convert values from one form to another.</p>
<p>For example, you can provide a decimal value and use a format specifier to output it as a hex. And while format specifiers start with the % they terminate, or rather are defined by, a type character. For example, %f, where f is the terminating character, is a format specifier for floating point numbers. When we&#39;re formatting a string, we&#39;re really just inserting values into a string. But we can use format specifiers to indicate how we want to insert values into a string. For example, you would format a number different than a date, right? Well, format specifiers can help you do that. There are tons of format specifiers, and even variations of individual specifiers. You can imagine that you can format numbers in loads of different ways, right?</p>
<p>The most common format specifiers are the ones shown here. %s is a really good catch-all that outputs anything as if it were a string. The %f and %d can be used for numbers, and the %t can be used to output timestamps in various ways. Let&#39;s take a look at an example of how you would use a format specifier to output a numeric value. In the code snippet that we see here, we create a new Formatter class and then call the format method on that class.</p>
<p>In the first parameter of the format method, we see a simple string with the value %d in it. The second parameter is the value -123. All this method does is take the value of -123 and replace the %d specifier in the string with that value. So the output of the println method that follows it would be a string with the value -123 in it. In the text block that follows, we do the same thing but with a positive 123. What we get in the output is exactly the same but this time not negative. All that shows us is that the %d specifier works whether the value is positive or negative. Now, you may recall from earlier in the course that we talked about escape characters.</p>
<p>Well, like an escape character, the percent character is special because it means the start of a format specifier. So what if you wanted to output a string that had the % in it? Well, let&#39;s take a look at this code snippet to see. In this code snippet, we once again create a new Formatter class and then call the format method against it. The value we pass into the format method is 100%%. What that tells the formatter class is that the percent symbol is not a specifier, but that we actually want to see the percent symbol in the output.</p>
<p>So the result when we run the code is 100%. Format specifiers can do some pretty fancy stuff while formatting a string. Let&#39;s take a look at this next code snippet for an example. In this code, we&#39;re yet again creating a Formatter class and calling the format method. This time, the first parameter, which is the format string, is set to &#34;%.5s&#34;. The second parameter, which is the value to replace the specifier with, is set to Hello world. This specifier is very interesting. What it&#39;s saying is that it wants to get the first five characters from the other parameter.</p>
<p>So if we look at the text Hello world, and then count out the first five characters, we can see that we should get the value of Hello back. And in fact, if we ran this code, that&#39;s exactly what the println command would show us. Finally, let&#39;s look at an example of how you would use the format specifier to output date values. In this code snippet, we create a date object and set its value to the first of January, 2021. In the next line, we use a simple string formatter to create a string with a formatted date in it. The first parameter of the format method includes three format specifiers, and the second parameter is our date.</p>
<p>Each of the three format specifiers starts with %1$. And what that tells the formatter is to use the first parameter in the list of parameters that follow the format string, and that the format specifier to use against that parameter will be found after the $. In this case, the format specifiers all start with t and then some other character. The t means that we want to treat the parameter as a date time. The character that follows the t tells us how to format that parameter. So tb means the month&#39;s full name, te means the day of the month and tY means the full four digit version of the year.</p>
<p>So in the end when the code is run, the output is January 1, 2021.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_12" /><h2 class="section_title">13.

<p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to go over the various formatting specifiers associated with the string class in Java. Sometimes we need to Output strings based on a known template and replace parts of that text with other known values, and then still format those values. In this demo, we&#39;re going to piggyback off the previous demos which we built in eclipse. So let&#39;s head over to the eclipse IDE now. All right, so I already have our project open from the previous demo, if you don&#39;t then go ahead and open that project now. Okay, so in all of our demos so far, we&#39;ve created and manipulated strings.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve also used special characters and even explored the various features of the string class itself. But there&#39;s one feature of the string class we haven&#39;t explored yet. In this demo, we&#39;re going to use the string format method to output a formatted message. All right, so the first thing we need to do is create a string template. So let&#39;s go to our main class. And we can do that by double clicking on the Main.java file in the package explorer panel on the left hand side of the screen. But I&#39;ve already got mine open. So in our previous demos, you can see that we&#39;ve created strings, used a string buffer and a string builder, and then demonstrated escape characters. In this demo, we&#39;re going to show how we might format a string.</p>
<p>And there are tonnes of situations where you&#39;ll want to do something like that. Probably the easiest to wrap our heads around is logging. So what I&#39;m going to do in this demo is create another method called log. And then we&#39;ll pass in some variables and ask for that information to be logged to the console. So let&#39;s get to it. Now the first thing we need to do is create a new method. To do that, we&#39;re going to add the following code after the main method bracket on line 29. Private static void log(String level, String message) {.</p>
<p>Good, now what we&#39;ve done here is we created a method that accepts two parameters, a log level and a log message. So now what we&#39;re going to do is output the message to the screen. So let&#39;s do that. Inside the method, let&#39;s write the following code, System.out.println(String.format(&#34;[%s] %s&#34;, level, message)) and semicolon. Now what this code is doing is creating a string that includes two values, the log level and the log message, and outputs it to the screen. The 2% s values indicate the place where the level and the message will be placed in the given string.</p>
<p>So now let&#39;s see that in action. Let&#39;s go back to the main method, and add a line of code at the end. Let&#39;s add Log(&#34;warning&#34;, &#34;My message&#34;);. Great, now in this line we&#39;re calling our method and populating the two needed parameters. So let&#39;s save this and run it to see what we can get. Now remember to run it&#39;s Ctrl F11. Look at that, now we&#39;re seeing our formatted log message nice, and we use the %s as a specifier. But what&#39;s a log message without a timestamp? Well, useless if you ask me, so let&#39;s add one.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s go back to the log method and add a line of code above our print line command. Let&#39;s type long now &#61; System.currentTimeMillis(); Now this line of code is creating a numeric value that represents the current date and time in milliseconds. Now let&#39;s use that value, in our format command, let&#39;s change the string. Let&#39;s add another [%s] to the beginning of the text. Good, now since we want our date to be the first item that&#39;s replaced. Let&#39;s add comma space now before the level perimeter.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 35 now reads: System.out.println(String.format(&#34;[%s][%s] %s&#34;, now, level, message));.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />Now let&#39;s save and run it. Awesome, now we also see a value that is our date. It&#39;s gross and totally eligible, but it&#39;s there and that&#39;s great. But it&#39;s not really great, is it?</p>
<p>I mean, we&#39;d much rather see the time wouldn&#39;t leave. Well, that&#39;s where the various string format specifiers come in. So far, we&#39;ve been using the %s, because it&#39;s a catch all and we&#39;ll display whatever we pass it. But since we want to format our date, we need to give it a different specifier. Now dates are a bit complicated because there&#39;s lots of ways you can format them. Generally a date format specifier starts with %t, but that&#39;s not enough. In fact, if you leave it as %t, it won&#39;t compile.</p>
<p>All the %t does, is tell the compiler that you want to treat the value like a timestamp, then it wants to know how to format the timestamp. To do that, we add an extra character after the t. So what we&#39;re going to do is, we&#39;re just going to output the full timestamp. So let&#39;s replace the first %s with the %tc, all lowercase. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 35 now reads: System.out.println(String.format(&#34;[%tc][%s] %s&#34;, now, level, message));.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />And now let&#39;s save it, and run it. That&#39;s much better, isn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>Now there are all kinds of different specifiers for all kinds of different data types, not just dates and strings. There are specifiers for characters and yes strings, Booleans, hex values, Unicode characters, octal, and numbers. In fact, let&#39;s explore numbers for a second. In our string format command, let&#39;s add another square bracket and %s after our level, but before our message. And now let&#39;s just hard-code a number in the list parameters. Now since we added this %s as the third item, you&#39;ll need to add our hard-coded number as the third item.</p>
<p>So all hard code the number 1,2,3,4,5. Now let&#39;s run it and see what we get.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 35 now reads: System.out.println(String.format(&#34;[%tc][%s] [%s]%s&#34;, now, level, 12345, message));.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Good, now that&#39;s exactly what we expect, isn&#39;t it? But wait a minute, what if I want to have my number have formatting with commas because it&#39;s in the 1000s? Well, I can do that by changing the specifier. The numbers specifier isn&#39;t a %s, it&#39;s a %d. So if we want commas in the number, we can change the specifier to %,d.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s do that.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 35 now reads: System.out.println(String.format(&#34;[%tc][%s] [%,d]%s&#34;, now, level, 12345, message));.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />And now let&#39;s save and run again. Perfect, now that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about. Now what else can we do with numbers? Well, numbers can have different sizes. So sometimes we want to align text and things like locks. So let&#39;s say we wanted to make sure that the number field in our log was always 20 characters in length, no matter the size of the number. Well, we can do that.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s replace that comma with the number 20. And let&#39;s save and run. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 35 now reads: System.out.println(String.format(&#34;[%tc][%s] [%20d]%s&#34;, now, level, 12345, message));.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />There, now we can see that the block is 20 characters in length. Now let&#39;s pretend we wanted to pad the field with zeros. Well, we could do that too, let&#39;s just add a 0 before the 20 and then save and rerun.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 35 now reads: System.out.println(String.format(&#34;[%tc][%s] [%020d]%s&#34;, now, level, 12345, message));.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>Nice, so now our field is populated with leading zeros. Well, let&#39;s say our number was always going to be five characters big. So let&#39;s change our specifier back to %5d.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 35 now reads: System.out.println(String.format(&#34;[%tc][%s] [%5d]%s&#34;, now, level, 12345, message));.</em> [Video description ends]<br /><br />And now let&#39;s save and run this. Okay, that&#39;s what we expect. Now for giggles let&#39;s change our number to negative 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And, let&#39;s save and run that.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 35 now reads: System.out.println(String.format(&#34;[%tc][%s] [%5d]%s&#34;, now, level, -12345, message));.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />In this case, because the negative side needs to be displayed, the field is now six characters long, not five. And that will bump everything out of alignment, well to fix that we can change the specifier to % 5d.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s do that. Good, now no real change this time, but let&#39;s remove that negative sign, save and run again. <br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 35 now reads: System.out.println(String.format(&#34;[%tc][%s] [%5d]%s&#34;, now, level, 12345, message));.</em> [Video description ends] <br /><br />Good, now there&#39;s a space allocated for a potential negative sign. Nice, and now just for one more example of a specifier. Let&#39;s pretend I wanted to output that number as a hex value. Well, I could do that pretty easily. Let&#39;s change that % 5d specifier to %#x.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 35 now reads: System.out.println(String.format(&#34;[%tc][%s] [%#x]%s&#34;, now, level, 12345, message));.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And then we&#39;ll save and run that. Look at that, our numbers converted to hex and output properly. But what if we prefer an uppercase x? Well, we can just change our x to an uppercase then. There you go, now it&#39;s uppercase. What if you prefer octal to hex? Well then we can change that X to an O.<br /><br />[Video description begins] <em>Line 35 now reads: System.out.println(String.format(&#34;[%tc][%s] [%#o]%s&#34;, now, level, 12345, message));.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>And there you go, there you have it. That&#39;s format specifiers for strings in Java, you can format all kinds of different things. Great job.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_13" /><h2 class="section_title">14.
