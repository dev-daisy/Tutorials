<p>Sooner or later, you&#39;ll find yourself in a situation where you have to execute a particular block of code multiple times. Maybe it&#39;s because you want to process a bunch of items in a list, or maybe it&#39;s because you want to search for something in a list. Whatever your reason, the way you&#39;ll do it is by executing a looping statement. Now, in Java, there are three main types of looping statements.</p>
<p>The for loop allows you to execute a loop based on indexes, conditions, or lists. The while loop allows you to perform a loop for as long as you deem necessary. And a do...while loop allows you to perform a loop for as long as you deem necessary, but it will always execute at least once. Now, all loops in Java are based on a condition. We don&#39;t want loops to execute forever. We want them to execute a logical number of times.</p>
<p>So the most important aspect of any loop is to devise a condition. Now, to make this a bit easier to understand, let me explain how a loop works by using this flow chart. In this chart, the loop starts right at the top, where it says START. Immediately, the loop checks the CONDITION. Now, that condition could be anything. It could be whether you want a certain count, it could be a time of day, it could be whether something is orange or not. Whatever the condition, it will return a TRUE or a FALSE. As long as the condition returns true, the loop will continue.</p>
<p>So when the condition is true, the loop will execute the code statements contained in that loop. Now, if the condition ever returns false, then the loop will stop. OK, so we understand loops in general, but why are there so many different kinds of loops? Well, it kind of depends on the specific work you&#39;re trying to do. By far, the most common type of loop is the for loop. Like any other loop, a for loop executes code statements that are contained inside that loop.</p>
<p>And it will execute those code statements repeatedly, over and over and over again. And it will do that as long as the defined condition is met. But the trick with a for loop is that you need to set an iteration parameter, create a condition and then provide an iteration command. The most common strategy for a for loop is to set a count for the number of times that you want to execute the loop.</p>
<p>And with each iteration of the loop, the current count is incremented. The condition is just that the current count is less than the total number of times that you want to execute the loop. Now, less common than a for loop, but still very common is the while loop. And just like the for loop, while loops execute the code statements that are contained inside that loop.</p>
<p>The difference between a for loop and a while loop is that a while loop will execute for as long as a given condition is true. You don&#39;t need to specify an iteration parameter or give any incrementation logic. It just executes as long as the given condition is true. The important thing to remember about the condition is that it&#39;s tested inside the definition of a loop. Well, more appropriately, it&#39;s tested first, before the statements in the loop are executed.</p>
<p>Then with each iteration of the loop, the condition is tested again. A common reason to execute a while loop is simply because we don&#39;t know how many iterations it will take to perform the task that we want to do. So, for example, imagine we wanted to know how many times we can divide a user-provided number by two until we get an answer of less than one. So our condition would be true for as long as the answer is greater than one and we simply don&#39;t know how many times that will take.</p>
<p>Now, there are actually two flavors of while loops. The other flavor is the do...while loop. A do...while loop is very similar to a while loop. Actually, it&#39;s exactly the same as a while loop, except for one crucial difference. The difference is that do...while loops test its condition after executing the code statements inside the loop. And what that means is that a do...while loop will always execute at least once.</p>
<p>So the code in the loop is executed and then the condition is tested. So why would we do that? Why would we ever execute a do...while loop if it means that we&#39;ll run the loop once? Well, one scenario I&#39;ve seen used is for something like initiation. Imagine you wanted to establish a connection to something. You&#39;ll want to execute the connection command and then if it fails, keep trying until it works. So the condition is true as long as the connection is not established.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_2" /><h2 class="section_title">3.

<p>In Java, there are a few different kinds of loops. Νow, which kind of loop you&#39;ll use is going to be dependent on the type of work that you&#39;re doing. But by far the most common type of loop is the for loop. Like any other loop, a for loop repeatedly executes code statements that are contained in that loop. Now how often the loop executes is based on an iterator and a condition. Now, every single time the loop executes, including the very first time, it will evaluate the condition to decide whether or not to keep going.</p>
<p>If the condition is met, meaning if it returns true, then the loop continues on. However, if the condition is not met, meaning it returns false, then the loop terminates. The most common strategy for a for loop is to set a count for the number of times that you want to execute the loop. Now, with each iteration of the loop, the current count is incremented. And the condition is just that the current count is less than the total number of times that you want to execute the loop.</p>
<p>Now, let me explain how a for loop works by going over this flow chart. When Java encounters a for loop, it will start the process of iteration, and the very first thing Java will do is evaluate the condition. Now, if the condition is true, then the code statements are executed. If the condition is false, then the loop immediately terminates. But it&#39;s important to understand that the condition is evaluated before any code is run, and that means that the condition can return false immediately and the contents of the loop will never execute at all.</p>
<p>Now, how do we build a for loop? Ηow can we make one work? Well, let&#39;s take a look at an example of what the syntax for a for loop would look like. What you see here is how the code for a for loop is laid out. Now, first, we tell Java that we&#39;re executing a for loop by typing the word for. Then in round brackets, we specify the conditions. Now it&#39;s important to see that the conditions for a for loop are actually broken down into three parts, the initialization, the condition, and the increment. And notice that they&#39;re separated by semicolons.</p>
<p>The initialization is run when the loop first starts and it&#39;s used to initialize incrementation variables. The condition is run at the start of each iteration, and it decides whether an iteration should happen at all. And the increment runs at the end of each iteration. It&#39;s usually used to increment the variable that we initialize. And I&#39;ll show you how that works in a second. Then for a for loop, you add squiggly brackets and then put whatever code you want to loop over inside those brackets.</p>
<p>Now, technically, if your for loop only has one line of code, you don&#39;t actually need the squiggly brackets. But it&#39;s a best practice to always use those brackets. So it&#39;s best to get into that habit. So let&#39;s go over a few examples and see this in action. All right, so here&#39;s an example of the most basic and simple for loop that you can have. In this code, we&#39;ve created a simple class with a static main method. And all that means is that when the Java project runs, this class will run right away.</p>
<p>Now, inside the main method, we can see a for loop. That loop has an initialization that says int i &#61; 0 and that means that there is now a variable called i that has been set to 0. And after that, we can see the condition and that it&#39;s been set to i is less than ten. And this means that the for loop will execute for as long as the value of that variable i is less than ten. And since we set it to 0, we know that this loop will execute at least once because zero is less than ten. Now after that, we see the increment and it&#39;s been set to i&#43;&#43;.</p>
<p>Now what this means is that every single time this loop executes, will increment the value of i by one. So if you put all that together, you can see that we&#39;re setting a variable to 0 incrementing it by one with each iteration of the loop, and then terminating the loop once that variable hits 10. Then inside the for loop squiggly brackets, we have the code that will be run each time the loop runs. In this case, we&#39;re using a simple print line command to output the value of our initialization variable to the console.</p>
<p>Now, remember that we initialize a variable to the number 0. So that means that the first iteration of the loop will see the value being equal to 0. And then we increment that variable with each iteration. And importantly, the condition allows a loop to run as long as it&#39;s less than 10. So that means the loop will run ten times and the value of i will be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and 9. But not 10. Now, this strategy is by far and away the most common looping strategy. A simple int i &#61; 0 and an i&#43;&#43; are the most obvious and common implementations of a for loop.</p>
<p>Of course, just because something is common, it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the only way to go. So let&#39;s go over another example so you can see what I mean. Now, let&#39;s imagine a scenario where you wanted to iterate over every second item in a list. Well, in that scenario, you&#39;ll set up the loop the same fundamental way. We&#39;d still initialize our variable to zero and we&#39;d still set up our condition to execute as long as we&#39;re less than a certain number. Now, where it changes is the incrementer.</p>
<p>Now, in this example, we set the initializer to 0, and we set the condition to run as long as that variable is less than 20. But then in the incrementer, we increment that variable by two using the i &#43;&#61; 2 syntax. Then inside the for loop squiggly brackets, we have the code that will run each time the loop runs and it&#39;s another simple print line command to output the value of our initialization variable to the console.</p>
<p>Now once again, remember that we initialized the variable to the number zero and that means the first iteration of the loop will see the value being equal to zero. And then we increment that variable by two with each iteration. And since our condition allows the loop to run as long as it&#39;s less than 20, that means the loop will be run ten times and the value of i will be 0,2,4,6,8,10, 12,14,16, and 18. But again, not 20. Now, it&#39;s also important to understand that we can also use our incrementation variable from anywhere inside the for loop.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s go over an example to show you what I mean. In this example, we define an integer variable outside the for loop and call it add, and we initialize it with a value of 10. Then we create a for loop that starts at 0 and runs as long as the i variable is less than ten and increments that i variable by one with each iteration. So we can tell from this definition that the loop will run ten times. Then inside the loop we add the current value of i to the add variable, and then print that out to the screen.</p>
<p>Now notice that we&#39;re using the &#43;&#61; syntax again. That means that we&#39;re changing the value of the add variable every run of the loop. So let&#39;s figure out what that means. While in the first run of the loop the add variable is set to 10 and our i variable is set to 0. Add those two and we&#39;re still left with 10. So the number 10 is output to the console. Now, on the second run, the add variable is still 10 and our i variable is now set to 1. If we add those two, then we have 11.</p>
<p>And on the third run, the add variable is now 11 and our i variable is 2. So adding those we get 13. And on the fourth run, the add variable is now 13, our i variable is 3, and combined they are 16. And on and on it goes as we get 20,25,31,38, 46, and 55 as our outputs, before we reach the point where our condition tells the loop to stop.</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s important to note that in Java there&#39;s the concept of scope. Our variable i is defined as part of the for loop so it can only be used inside the for loop. If you were outside the for loop and tried to access the value of i, Java would break and not know what you&#39;re actually talking about.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_3" /><h2 class="section_title">4.

<p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to look at creating a simple for loop in Java. We&#39;ll use a simple iterator to count to ten and output the value to the console. Now, to do all that, we&#39;re going to create a project in Eclipse. All right. So as I said, we&#39;re going to use the free Eclipse IDE in this demo. But you can use any other kind of Java IDE and it&#39;ll work equally fine. Anyway, let&#39;s go ahead and open the Eclipse IDE now. OK, so the first thing we&#39;re going to want to do is create a new project.</p>
<p>In Eclipse, that&#39;s as simple as opening the File menu, selecting New, Java Project. Now, when you create a project, you need to give it a name. [Video description begins] <em>A window opens that reads: Create a Java Project. The first option reads: Project name. There is an empty field. Below are further sections that read: JRE, Project layout and Working sets.</em> [Video description ends] So for the sake of this demo, I&#39;m just going to call my project demo12. Now, for loops have been around since the inception of Java and they&#39;re super common, so there&#39;s nothing special beyond setting the name that we have to do.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s just leave all the defaults as they are and click &#34;Finish&#34;. Good. Now it asks us for a module name. [Video description begins] <em>Another window appears that contains a required field to specify a module name. Below is the button Create.</em> [Video description ends] Now, this isn&#39;t super important for what we&#39;re trying to do in this course, so let&#39;s just leave this as the default and click &#34;Create&#34;. Perfect. Now our project is created and we&#39;re just about ready to get started with for loops. Before we can actually start coding with for loops, we need a file to code in. So let&#39;s go ahead and do that.</p>
<p>First, let&#39;s close the module tab that opened up on our screen. All right, now, in order to be able to play with code, you first need to have an entry point into this project. So let&#39;s do that by creating a main class. Now, from the File menu, let&#39;s select New, Class. [Video description begins] <em>A window appears that reads: Create a new Java class. There is a field, labeled Source Folder, set to demo12/src and a field labeled Package, set to demo12. There are also fields to specify Name, Modifiers and options to create method stubs. Below is the button Finish.</em> [Video description ends] Perfect. Now in the pop-up, we&#39;re being asked for information about our class.</p>
<p>Now, the Source folder and Package are pointed to the root of our project by default, and that&#39;s fine for our purposes. But let&#39;s give this class a Name. In this case, let&#39;s call it Main with a capital M. Now, we&#39;ll leave the Modifiers, the Superclass and Interfaces as the defaults, but let&#39;s make sure that we check the public static void main method stub checkbox, and let&#39;s leave all the others unchecked. And good. Now let&#39;s click &#34;Finish&#34;. Excellent. We have our class. And now, we&#39;re finally ready to get started.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s start by creating a list of things. [Video description begins] <em>Line 1 reads: package demo12;, line 3 reads: public class Main {, line 5 reads: public static void main(String[] args) {.</em> [Video description ends] In fact, our list of things will be colors. So on line 6, let&#39;s replace the comment with this code. String, with a capital S, [] colors &#61; {&#34;blue&#34;, &#34;white&#34;, &#34;red&#34;, &#34;green&#34;, &#34;yellow&#34;, &#34;orange&#34;} and ; Good, now we have a list of colors, blue, white, red, green, yellow, and orange. So what we want to do next is create a loop that will iterate over all the items in that list and output the results to the console for us to see.</p>
<p>In fact, let&#39;s do that. Let&#39;s drop a couple of lines down from our list and type the following code. [Video description begins] <em>The host types in line 8.</em> [Video description ends] for(int i &#61; 0; i &lt; colors.length; i&#43;&#43;) and the {. Perfect. Now, what this code is telling Java is that we want to execute a for loop. Now, the first part of the for loop is an iteration variable that we&#39;ve called i and we&#39;ve set it to 0. Then we specified a condition that tells the loop to keep iterating as long as our i variable is less than the total number of items in our colors list.</p>
<p>And the last part of the loop definition tells Java to increment our i variable by one, every time the loop executes. The result is that this loop will execute as many times as there are items in our colors list. OK, so let&#39;s output the colors to the screen. Νow inside the for loop, let&#39;s type the following code. [Video description begins] <em>The host types in line 9.</em> [Video description ends] System.out.print(colors[i] &#43; &#34; &#34;); Good. Now what this code is doing is it&#39;s calling our colors list with an index or equal to our i variable. In the first iteration of the for loop, the i variable is set to 0.</p>
<p>And so that means that it&#39;ll access the first item in the colors list. Then in the second iteration of the loop, the i variable is set to one, which means that it&#39;ll access the second item in the colors list. And the color value at each iteration is then output to the console using the System.out.print command. Now I&#39;ve added a space here so that we can see each color in the console separated by a space. So let&#39;s see this in action, shall we? First, we save the file using the Ctrl&#43;S command.</p>
<p>And now we can execute the project by using the Ctrl&#43;F11 command. Wow, excellent. So now we can see in the console log, at the bottom of the screen that we&#39;re successfully outputting each color in the same order as the list. Nicely done. But let&#39;s do something a little bit different. Let&#39;s process the items in reverse order. First, let&#39;s make sure the console sees this as a new line. So let&#39;s add the following code directly after our for loop. [Video description begins] <em>Line 10 contains a }. The host types in line 11.</em> [Video description ends]</p>
<p>System.out.print line (&#34;&#34;) and don&#39;t forget that semicolon. Now, let&#39;s add another for loop directly below that print-line command. So let&#39;s type the following code: for(int i &#61; colors.length; i &gt; 0; i--) and the {. Now, what this code is doing is it&#39;s setting our iterator value to the size of our colors list. Then the condition says that the loop will execute for as long as the variable is greater than zero. And finally, the iteration variable subtracts one from the i variable every time the loop runs.</p>
<p>So our first loop counted up from zero to the size of our list. But this loop will count down from the size of our list to zero. So let&#39;s output the colors to the screen. Now, inside the new for loop, let&#39;s add the following code. System.out.print(colors[i - 1] &#43; &#34; &#34;) and don&#39;t forget that semicolon. Now, this code is outputting the color to the console, just like our last loop. But the difference here is that we have to add a - 1 to the indexer.</p>
<p>Now, the reason for that is because indexes in Java are all zero-based. When we set the i variable to the size of our loop, we&#39;re actually setting it to a value of six, the size of our list. But that&#39;s not a real index, because the sixth item in the list is actually at index five. So that&#39;s why we have to subtract one. So let&#39;s see this in action. Let&#39;s save the file and run the project. Nice, now we&#39;re seeing our list of colors in reverse order. Nice job.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_4" /><h2 class="section_title">5.

Your host for this session is Sven Batalla.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>Now, in Java, there&#39;s the option to use an enhanced kind of for loop as well. Sometimes people even call it a for-each loop. And enhanced for loops have been around since about version 5 of Java. Now, the best part of enhanced for loops is that it&#39;s a very simple method for iteration. The idea behind enhanced for loops is that you can give them a list like an array, and then they&#39;ll automatically iterate over each item in the list without you having to specify iteration variables, conditions or an increment.</p>
<p>Now, as I said, enhanced for loops are really simple to use. All you have to do is specify the list you want to iterate over and a variable that you want each item in the list to be associated to in each iteration. Now, what that means is that these loops are super rigid. Remember that a regular for loop needs you to specify the iterator, the condition and the increment. Then if you want it to access an item in an array, you&#39;d have to use the iterator as an index.</p>
<p>So that&#39;s a bunch of moving parts that are handled for you automatically by Java with enhanced for loops. And that means way less room for error. Now, that being said, the main thing to remember is that enhanced for loops are used for arrays or lists of things. They can&#39;t be used for anything else or really in any other way. Now, with enhanced for loops, the process is quite simple. You give it a list of some kind and it will step through the list for you, one by one. Every item in the list will be iterated over for you to run whatever code you wish.</p>
<p>Now the order of the loop is also fixed. It will always go first-to-last. You can&#39;t specify jumps and you can&#39;t go in any different order. Certainly, you can manipulate the list, or do fancy things in the code to achieve that if you want to. But the actual definition of the loop means that the list is processed one by one, first to last. But the big advantage of the enhanced for loop is that there&#39;s no need for an index. You give it a list and it populates a variable with the item being iterated over.</p>
<p>So how do we build an enhanced for loop? How can we make that work? Well, first, let&#39;s take a look at what the syntax of an enhanced for loop looks like. What you see here is how the code for an enhanced for loop is laid out. First, we tell Java that we&#39;re executing an enhanced for loop the same way that we tell it that we&#39;re executing a for loop, by typing the word for. Then in round brackets, we specify the details.</p>
<p>Now, it&#39;s important to see that the details of an enhanced for loop is actually broken down into two parts: a variable and a list. And notice how they&#39;re separated by a colon. The variable is processed at the start of each iteration. So on the first run, the enhanced for loop looks at the given list and populates the variable with the very first item in the list. Then on the second run, the enhanced for loop looks at the given list and populates the variable with the second item in the list. And it keeps doing that until there are no more items in the list to process.</p>
<p>And importantly, that means that if you give the loop an empty list, it won&#39;t do anything at all. Then, just like the regular for loop, you add squiggly brackets and put whatever code you want to loop over inside those brackets. Generally, you then access the variable from the loop definition to do whatever you need to do. So let&#39;s go over a few examples to see this in action. Now, in this example, we create an array of integers that we call numbers. Inside that array, we see the numbers 13,30,47,72, and 99.</p>
<p>Then below the array definition, we create an enhanced for loop and we pass in our numbers list. We also create an integer variable called number, before the colon. So what this means is that every time the loop iterates, the variable called number will be set to the next value in our numbers array. Now, meanwhile, inside the loop, we have a simple print line command that outputs the value of the number variable to the console.</p>
<p>So the first iteration of the loop would see the number variable being set to the first value in the numbers array, 13. Then the next iteration would see the number variable being set to the second value in the numbers array, 30. And this would continue until there are no more items left in the array to process. And finally, let&#39;s go over one more example. It&#39;s important to understand that the enhanced for loop can go over any list.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t have to be just numbers. In this example, we&#39;ve created a simple list of strings. Each entry in the array is a breed of dog, &#34;Retriever&#34;, &#34;Terrier&#34;, &#34;Chihuahua&#34;, and &#34;Bulldog&#34;. Then we set up an advanced for loop and this iterates over the list of breeds and puts each value into a string called breed. And then that value is output to the console. So the result is Retriever, Terrier, Chihuahua, and Bulldog. Pretty easy, isn&#39;t it? Well, that&#39;s why they&#39;re enhanced for loops.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_5" /><h2 class="section_title">6.

<p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to implement an enhanced for loop in Java. Specifically, we&#39;re going to output the contents of a list to the console without the use of an iterator variable or conditions. To do all that, we&#39;re going to piggyback off our previous demo, which we built in Eclipse. So let&#39;s head over to the Eclipse IDE now. All right, so I already have our project open from the previous demo. Now, if you don&#39;t, go ahead and open the project now and let&#39;s get back to our main class if you haven&#39;t.</p>
<p>And you can do that by double-clicking on the Main.java file in the Package Explorer panel on the left-hand side of the screen. OK, so in our last demo, we created two for loops to iterate over a list of colors that we also created. The first loop iterated over the list in forwards order and the second iterated over the list in reverse order. In both cases, we needed to specify an iteration variable, a condition, and then an increment.</p>
<p>And then we needed to access our array of colors by using an indexer. It was relatively simple, but it&#39;s also a bit tedious and inconvenient. In this demo, we&#39;re going to simplify the process by using an enhanced for loop. OK, so the first thing we&#39;re going to want to do is drop down a couple of lines from our last for loop and add a line of code to put a break in the console. [Video description begins] <em>The host types in line 16.</em> [Video description ends] So let&#39;s type System.out.println(&#34;&#34;); Good. Now let&#39;s create an enhanced for loop.</p>
<p>We can do that by typing the following code: for(String, with a capital S, color : colors) and then the {. Perfect. So what we&#39;ve done here is we&#39;ve created an enhanced for loop that iterates through all of the items in the colors list that we created in our last demo. Now, during each iteration of the loop, the current item being processed, that is the current color, will be placed into the variable that we&#39;ve called color.</p>
<p>Now, inside the loop, let&#39;s type the following code. [Video description begins] <em>The host types in line 18.</em> [Video description ends] System.out.print(color &#43; &#34; &#34;) and don&#39;t forget that semicolon. Good. Now what this code is doing is it&#39;s outputting the value of the color variable to the console, along with a space at the end. So let&#39;s see this code in action, shall we? Let&#39;s save the file with a Ctrl&#43;S and run the project with a Ctrl&#43;F11.</p>
<p>Awesome. Now we&#39;re seeing our list of colors in the console at the bottom of the screen, and that&#39;s great. And notice how they&#39;re in the same order as the list we gave. [Video description begins] <em>The colors appear in line one in the order: blue white red green yellow orange, and in the line below in the opposite order: orange yellow green red white blue, and in the next line again in the opposite order from the last line.</em> [Video description ends] That&#39;s important because it shows that the enhanced for loop always runs first to last. So we can see from the code that iterating over an array of items is a lot easier with an enhanced for loop than it is with a regular loop. But what if we wanted to iterate over our list in reverse order like we did with the regular for loop?</p>
<p>We&#39;ve just said that an enhanced for loop can only iterate first to last. So that means that we&#39;d have to manipulate the list outside of the loop. So let me show you. First, we need to import a few packages. So at the top of the code, between the package definition and the class definition, let&#39;s add these three lines of code: [Video description begins] <em>The host types in line 3.</em> [Video description ends] import java.util.Arrays with a capital A ; import java.util.Collections; with a capital C and then import java.util.List with a capital L, and don&#39;t forget that semicolon. Good.</p>
<p>Now, these packages will give us access to some tools that we need to manipulate our colors list. Now back inside the main method, let&#39;s drop down to the next line after our enhanced for loop and add a print-line statement to help separate our console output. [Video description begins] <em>The host types in line 24.</em> [Video description ends] System.out.print(&#34;&#34;), and of course the semicolon. Good. And now let&#39;s begin. The first thing we want to do is create a new list so that we don&#39;t hurt our existing list. So let&#39;s type the following code.</p>
<p>List&lt;String, with a capital S, &gt; colors2 &#61; Arrays, with a capital A, .asList, with a capital L, (colors.clone() and then ). And of course, don&#39;t forget that semicolon. Fix the typo. There we go. Nice. Now, what this code is doing is it&#39;s creating a whole new list object, an actual list object in this case, and its initial value is set to the contents of our existing colors. Now we&#39;re cloning the arrays so that we don&#39;t affect the original list. Now we&#39;ve named the new list colors2. Now on the next line, let&#39;s type the following code.</p>
<p>Collections, with a capital C, .reverse(colors2) and the ; Now, what this code is doing is it&#39;s taking the contents of our new list and reversing it. Now let&#39;s create an enhanced for loop to iterate over the new list. Let&#39;s type the following code. for(String, with a capital S, color : colors2) and then the {. Nice. So this is just like our other enhanced for loop, except it&#39;s iterating over our new list. So let&#39;s add the console output-line inside the loop.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s type System.out.print(color &#43; &#34; &#34;) and of course, the semicolon. Perfect. Now we&#39;ve created a new list from our first one, we&#39;ve reversed it, and now we&#39;re iterating over the contents of that list. It&#39;s still first to last, but the list itself has been reversed. So let&#39;s see it in action. Let&#39;s save our file and run the project. Very nice, we&#39;re seeing a reversed list. Excellent job.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_6" /><h2 class="section_title">7.

You’ll view a flowchart in Java to help explain this.</p></div><h3 class="list_title">Objectives</h3><ul class="list"><li class="list_item">describe while loops in Java</li></ul><div class="section inner"><div class="section_text">[Video description begins] <em>Topic title: Java While Loops. Your host for this session is Sven Batalla.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>In Java, another kind of loop that you can implement is a while loop. While loops repeat forever, as long as their condition remains true. So it&#39;s not based on an iterator, like a for loop, or list, like an enhanced for loop, but rather just an arbitrary decision as to what condition allows the loop to stop. Importantly, like the for loop, the condition for a while loop is tested inside the definition statement, or more accurately, it&#39;s evaluated before the loop is entered.</p>
<p>To illustrate how a while loop works, consider this flowchart. Ιn Java, when the while loop is encountered, the first thing that happens is that the condition defined in the while loop is immediately evaluated. If the condition is false, the loop immediately terminates. Importantly, that means that the condition can be false right away and the loop never actually executes at all.</p>
<p>However, if the condition is true, then the loop will continue and all the code statements inside that loop will be executed according to whatever logic and testing statements that you&#39;ve defined. So how do we build a while loop, how can we make that work? Well, let&#39;s first take a look at what the syntax of a while loop looks like. What you see here is how the code for a while loop is laid out. First, we tell Java that we&#39;re executing a while loop by typing the word while. Then in round brackets, we specify the conditions.</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s important to see that the conditions of a while loop are actually just a single statement. Now, you may have multiple conditions in that statement, this and that, or this or that, but the important part is that the totality of the conditions needs to return true or false, and I&#39;ll show you how that works in a second. Then for a while loop, you add squiggly brackets and then put whatever code you want to loop over inside those brackets.</p>
<p>Now, technically, just like a for loop, if there is only one line, you don&#39;t need the squiggly brackets. But it&#39;s best practice to always use those brackets. So it&#39;s best to get into that habit. So let&#39;s go over a couple of examples to see this in action. Now, before we get too deep into while loops, it&#39;s important that we explain one of the real dangers of a while loop. To illustrate, consider this example. In this code, we create a variable called i and we set its value to 0.</p>
<p>Then we create a while loop and set the conditions so that it will execute for as long as the i variable is less than ten. Now, inside the loop, we simply output the value of the i variable to the console. Seems pretty normal, right? In fact, astute observers will note that this is a lot like a for loop except for one crucial problem. The i variable is never incremented. But why is that a problem? Well, it means that the i variable is set to zero and never changes, and that means that it&#39;s always less than ten, and that means that the while loop will execute forever.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s dangerous. If a while loop executes forever, it&#39;s called an infinite loop. And infinite loops are dangerous to the systems that they run on, because they&#39;ll continuously take up compute power or even memory. If left unchecked, an infinite loop can starve your system of needed resources and eventually result in system crashes. So what you want to do with a while loop is be very careful to make sure that there&#39;s a clear condition under which it will end.</p>
<p>In fact, if we take the same example that we just had, all we&#39;d have to do is add one more piece of code and we&#39;d be all good. In this case, we&#39;ve added an incrementation to our i variable. So what that means is now the i variable will increment by one, every time the while loop executes. Then at some point, it will increment to the number ten and then the condition will return false because the value is now greater than or equal to ten. And that will signal the end of the while loop.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_7" /><h2 class="section_title">8.

<p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to implement a while loop in Java. Specifically, we&#39;re going to output the contents of a list to the console without the use of an iterator. To do all that, we&#39;re going to piggyback off of our previous demo, which we built in Eclipse. So let&#39;s head over to the Eclipse IDE now. All right, so I already have our project open from the previous demo, but if you don&#39;t, go ahead and open it now and you&#39;ll need to access the main class.</p>
<p>So you can do that by double-clicking Main.java in the Package Explorer panel on the left-hand side of the screen. OK, so in our last couple of demos, we created some for loops and we iterated over a list of colors that we created in the first demo. The first set of for loops iterated over the list of colors forwards and backwards, using an iteration variable and conditions.</p>
<p>Our second set of for loops use the enhanced for loop mechanism to iterate over the list, first to last. We had to create a second list and reverse it in order to go backwards. In this demo, we&#39;re going to try to do the same thing, but using a while loop instead. OK, so the first thing we&#39;re going to want to do is drop down a couple of lines from our last for loop and add a line of code to put a break in the console. So let&#39;s type System.out.println(&#34;&#34;) and the ; [Video description begins] <em>The host types in line 31.</em> [Video description ends] Good. Now we&#39;re just about ready to create our while loop. Now what we want to do is we want to mimic our for loop.</p>
<p>So to do that, we need an iteration variable. So let&#39;s type the following code on the next line. int w &#61; 0; Now, all we&#39;ve done here is we&#39;ve created an integer and set its value to 0. Now, this is like the i variable that we created earlier. Now, I chose not to call it i, because I don&#39;t want to collide with my for loops. Anyways, let&#39;s finally create a while loop.</p>
<p>We can do this by typing the following code on the next line. while(w &lt; colors.length) and then the {. Perfect. So what we&#39;ve done here is we created a while loop that loops as long as our w variable is less than the number of colors that we have in our list. Now, inside the loop, let&#39;s type the following code. System.out.print(colors[w] &#43; &#34; &#34;) and of course the semicolon.</p>
<p>Now, what this code is doing is it&#39;s outputting the value of the colors list at whatever index our variable w is at. Now remember that a while loop is dangerous if we don&#39;t make it so that the condition can end up being false. So right now, the w variable will always be less than the length of the colors list. So we need to add an increment before we can call this code done. So let&#39;s do that. Now right after the print command, let&#39;s add this code: w&#43;&#43;;</p>
<p>Perfect. Now let&#39;s see this code in action. Let&#39;s save the file with a Ctrl&#43;S and run the project with a Ctrl&#43;F11. Awesome. Now, we&#39;re seeing our list of colors in the console at the bottom of the screen and it&#39;s in the correct order. That&#39;s great. OK, but what if we wanted to output the list in reverse order like we did with our previous for loops? Well, let&#39;s do it.</p>
<p>First, let&#39;s make sure that the console sees this on a new line. So let&#39;s add the following code directly after our while loop. System.out.println(&#34;&#34;); Good. Now, let&#39;s also reset our w variable. Let&#39;s type the following code on the next line. w &#61; colors.length; Nice. Now, what we&#39;ve done here is we&#39;ve set the w variable to be equal to the size of our color list. Now let&#39;s add another while loop. Now let&#39;s type the following code on the next line.</p>
<p>while( w &gt; 0)and then the {. Perfect. Now what this code is doing is it&#39;s saying that we&#39;re going to execute anything that&#39;s inside this while loop as long as the w variable is greater than zero. So let&#39;s output the colors to the console. Inside the new while loop, let&#39;s type the following code. System.out.print(colors[w - 1] &#43; &#34; &#34;) and of course, our semicolon. Now, this code is outputting the color to the console, just like our last loop. But the difference here is that we&#39;ve added a -1 to the indexer.</p>
<p>And again, the reason for that is because indexes in Java are all zero-based. So when we set the w variable to the size of our color list, we&#39;re actually setting it to six, the size of the list. And that&#39;s not a real index. The sixth item is actually at index five. So that&#39;s why we have to subtract one. But remember, again, a while loop is dangerous if we don&#39;t make it so, the condition can end up being false. And right now the w variable will always be greater than zero.</p>
<p>So we need to add a decrement before we can call this code done. So let&#39;s do that. Now right after the print command, let&#39;s add this code. w--; Perfect. Now let&#39;s see this code in action. Let&#39;s save the file and run the project. Nice. Now we&#39;re seeing the list of colors and we&#39;re seeing it in reverse order. Great job.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_8" /><h2 class="section_title">9.

This means a do...while loop is executed at least once.</p>
<p>You’ll also learn the reasons to use a do...while loop instead of a while loop.</p></div><h3 class="list_title">Objectives</h3><ul class="list"><li class="list_item">describe do-while loops in Java</li></ul><div class="section inner"><div class="section_text">[Video description begins] <em>Topic title: Java Do-While Loops. Your host for this session is Sven Batalla.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>Now, in Java, there&#39;s the option to use another kind of while loop as well. It&#39;s called the do...while loop. It&#39;s virtually identical to the while loop, but it has one crucial difference. The difference between a while loop and a do...while loop is that the condition that decides whether to continue the iteration is tested outside the code or more accurately, it&#39;s tested after the first iteration. Crucially, that means that a do...while loop is always executed at least once.</p>
<p>So why use a do...while loop instead of a while loop? Well, you&#39;d want to use a do...while loop in situations where a single execution is needed and then you can decide on looping thereafter. So a common scenario is when you want to implement a retry. So imagine you want to connect to something like, say, a database. Now, you could put that in a do...while loop, and if the connection is successful on the first try, well, then it&#39;s done.</p>
<p>But if the connection attempt fails, you may want to try again and again until it does work. Now, to illustrate how a do...while loop works, consider this flowchart. In Java, when the do...while loop is encountered, it sort of ignores the statement. Instead, the first thing that happens is that the code statements inside the loop are all executed based on whatever logic is coded. Then once the code has been executed, that&#39;s when the condition is evaluated. If the condition is true, then the loop runs again. If the condition is false, then the loop terminates.</p>
<p>Importantly, that means that the loop will run at least once. So how do we build a do...while loop? How can we make that work? Well, first, let&#39;s take a look at what the syntax of a do...while loop looks like. Now, what you see here is how the code for a do...while loop is laid out. First, we tell Java that we&#39;re executing a do...while loop by typing the word do. Then just like other loops that we&#39;ve had so far, you add squiggly brackets and then put whatever code you want to loop over inside those brackets. Now, it&#39;s important to note that with a do...while loop, you must always have the squiggly brackets.</p>
<p>Then finally, after the closing squiggly bracket, we add the keyword while. Then we can finally add a condition inside the round brackets after the while keyword. Now, just like a regular while loop, the conditions of a do...while loop are actually just a single statement. You may have multiple conditions in that statement, this and that, or this or that, but the important part is that the totality of the conditions need to return true or false. And I&#39;ll show you how that works in a second. Now, finally, and most importantly, the do...while loop is terminated with a semicolon.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s go over a few examples to see this in action. Now, before we get too deep in to do...while loops, it&#39;s important that we explain one of the real dangers of a do...while loop. In fact, it&#39;s the same danger that we have with a regular while loop. To illustrate, consider this example. In this code snippet, we create a variable called i, and then we set its value to zero. Then we create a do...while loop and we set the conditions so that this will execute for as long as the i variable is less than ten.</p>
<p>Now, inside the loop, we simply output the value of the i variable to the console, and that seems pretty normal too, doesn&#39;t it? But again, there&#39;s just one problem. The i variable is never incremented. So again, why is this a problem? Well, it means that the i variable is set to zero and never, ever changes. So that means that it&#39;s always less than ten. And that means that the do...while loop will execute forever. And that&#39;s dangerous. If a do...while loop executes forever, then that&#39;s called an infinite loop.</p>
<p>And infinite loops are dangerous to the systems that they run on because they&#39;ll continuously take up compute power or even memory. If left unchecked, an infinite loop can starve your system of needed resources and eventually result in system crashes. And nobody wants that. So what you want to do with a do...while loop is be very careful to make sure that there&#39;s a clear condition under which it will end.</p>
<p>In fact, if we take the same example that we just had, all we&#39;d have to do is add one more piece of code and then we&#39;d be all good. In this case, we&#39;ve added the incrementation to our i variable with an i&#43;&#43;. So what that means is that now the i variable will increment by one every time the do...while loop executes. Then at some point, it will increment to the number ten and the condition will return false. And that will signal the end of the do...while loop.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_9" /><h2 class="section_title">10.

<p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to implement a do...while loop in Java. Specifically, we&#39;re going to output the contents of a list to the console without the use of an iterator. To do all that, we&#39;re going to piggyback off our previous demo, which we built in Eclipse. So let&#39;s head over to the Eclipse IDE now. All right, so I already have our project open from the previous demo, and if you don&#39;t, go ahead and open the project now. And of course, we&#39;re going to need access to our main class.</p>
<p>So make sure you open that by double-clicking on the Main.java file in the Package Explorer panel on the left-hand side of the screen. OK, so in our last few demos, we created some for loops and while loops to iterate over a list of colors to the console, both forwards and backwards. The for loops used iteration techniques as well as an enhanced mechanism meant for lists. Meanwhile, our while loops mimicked the for loop strategy by creating an iterator variable two.</p>
<p>Now in this demo, we&#39;re going to do the same thing again, but this time we&#39;re going to use a do...while loop instead. OK, so the first thing we&#39;re going to want to do is drop down a couple of lines of code from our last while loop and add a line of code to put a break in the console. So let&#39;s type System.out.println(&#34;&#34;) and ; Now, we&#39;re just about ready to create our do...while loop. Now, what we want to do is mimic the loops that we&#39;ve created so far.</p>
<p>So to do that, we need an iteration variable. So let&#39;s type the following code: int dw &#61; 0; Now, all we&#39;ve done here is create an integer variable and set its value to 0. Now this is like the i and w variables that we created earlier and I chose not to call it i or w, because I don&#39;t want to collide with my existing loops. Anyway, let&#39;s finally create a do...while loop. Now we can do that by typing the following code on the next line: do and then {. Perfect.</p>
<p>So what we&#39;ve done here is we&#39;ve created the start of a do...while loop. But you can see that Java doesn&#39;t like it yet. That&#39;s because we haven&#39;t given it a condition. Now, to do that, we need to type the following code right after the closing squiggly bracket: while(dw &lt; colors.length) and a ; Now pay special attention to that semicolon. Unlike our other loops, a do...while loop needs that semicolon to say that it&#39;s fully defined. Anyway, so what we&#39;ve done here is we&#39;ve defined a loop that will iterate for as long as our dw variable is less than the number of colors that we have in our list.</p>
<p>Now, inside the loop, let&#39;s type the following code. System.out.print(colors[dw] &#43; &#34; &#34;) and, of course, a semicolon. Now, what this code is doing is it&#39;s outputting the value of the colors list at whatever index our variable dw is at. Now, remember, a do...while loop is dangerous in the same way as a while loop, if we don&#39;t make it so the condition can end up being false, we could end up with an infinite loop. Now, right now, the dw variable will always be less than the length of colors. So we need to add an increment before we can call this code done.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s do that. Now right after the print command, let&#39;s add the following code. dw&#43;&#43;; Perfect. Now, let&#39;s see this code in action, shall we? Let&#39;s save the file with a Ctrl&#43;S and then run the project with a Ctrl&#43;F11. Awesome. Now we&#39;re seeing our list of colors in the console at the very bottom of the screen, and that&#39;s great. OK, but what if we wanted to output the list in reverse order, just like we did with our previous loops? Well, let&#39;s do it.</p>
<p>First, let&#39;s make sure the console sees this on a new line. So let&#39;s add the following code directly after our do...while loop. System.out.println(&#34;&#34;); Good. Now, let&#39;s reset our dw variable. On the next line, let&#39;s type the following code. dw &#61; colors.length; Nice. Now, what we&#39;ve done there is we&#39;ve set the dw variable to be equal to the size of our color list. Now let&#39;s add another do...while loop. And once again, let&#39;s type the following code: do and then {. Good. Now, just like last time, let&#39;s add a condition right after the final squiggly bracket.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s add the following code: while(dw &gt; 0 and then ) and the ; and once again, don&#39;t forget that semicolon. All right. Now, what this code is saying is that we&#39;re going to execute anything that&#39;s inside this do...while loop as long as the dw variable is greater than zero. So let&#39;s output the colors to the screen. Inside the new do...while loop, let&#39;s type the following code. System.out.print(colors[dw - 1] &#43; &#34; &#34;) and the ; Now this code is outputting the color to the console, just like our last loop. And the difference here is that we&#39;ve added a -1 to the indexer.</p>
<p>And again, the reason for that is because indexes in Java are all zero-based. So when we set the dw variable to the size of our list, we&#39;re actually setting it to six, which is the size of the list. But that&#39;s not a real index. The sixth item in the list is actually at index five. So that&#39;s why we have to subtract one. Now, again, remember, a do...while loop is dangerous, if we don&#39;t make it so the condition can end up being false, and right now the dw variable will always be greater than zero.</p>
<p>So we need to add a decrement before we can call this code complete. So let&#39;s do that. Right after the print command, let&#39;s add the following code. dw--; All right, let&#39;s see this code in action. Let&#39;s save the file and run the project. Nice. Now, we&#39;re seeing our list of colors in reverse order. Nice job. OK, let&#39;s do one more thing just to show how while loops and do...while loops are different. The main difference between a while loop and a do...while loop is that a do...while loop always executes once and then checks the condition.</p>
<p>To prove that in our last while loop, let&#39;s change the condition from w &gt; 0 to w &gt; 100. [Video description begins] <em>The host changes the while loop in line 39.</em> [Video description ends] Now, remember that with a while loop, the condition is evaluated and the loop terminates as soon as it&#39;s false. Now, importantly, the condition is evaluated first. So what we&#39;ve done here is we said that the while loop is allowed to execute as long as the w variable is greater than 100, which it isn&#39;t. So the result will be false.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s see what happens when we execute this. Nice. Now, we suddenly have a blank line in the console output, and that shows that that while loop never executed. Meanwhile, let&#39;s do the same thing with our last do...while loop. Let&#39;s change the condition from dw &gt; 0, to dw &gt; 100. Now, just like the while loop, if that condition is false, which it will be now, the loop will terminate. The difference is that with a do...while loop, the condition is evaluated after the loop is run the first time.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s see what happens when we execute this. Nice. Now, we didn&#39;t get a blank line, we just got the value orange. And that&#39;s because the loop executed once and got the last value in the array because we&#39;re going over it backwards and output it to the console. Then it checked the condition and then it stopped running. Great job.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_10" /><h2 class="section_title">11.

Your host for this session is Sven Batalla.</em> [Video description ends]
<p>When it comes to programming, using a loop is basically inevitable. Be it the for loop, the while loop, the do...while loop, or even the enhanced for loop, you&#39;re going to want to make sure that you implement best practices into your loop. One of the most important best practices is to create loops in the most compact way possible. You want to keep your code clean. Now, in my day, I&#39;ve seen tons of loops that contain additional condition statements, method calls and even nested loops, and that never ends well.</p>
<p>The complexity is super high and it&#39;s extremely difficult to manage and maintain. The other thing you&#39;re going to want to consider is performance. Now, remember that the whole point of a loop is to run a certain block of code multiple times. And with loops, those loops are generally synchronous, meaning that they execute one after the other. So if you have a complex or long running piece of code inside a loop, the performance of your application may be well below where you want it to be.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you need a connection to something and it takes a long time or lots of memory to establish that connection, consider establishing that connection outside the loop and then just using the reference inside your loop. And the final best practice is to watch the number of variables that you&#39;re creating and using inside the loop. Now, each iteration of a loop is like its own method call and has its own memory space.</p>
<p>So if you create variables inside your loop, that&#39;s fine. But just remember that you&#39;ll be creating those variables every time the loop iterates. So, again, if you have an object that takes lots of memory and you create it with every iteration, you can find yourself using a lot of memory very, very quickly. And it doesn&#39;t have to be a big object either. I once had a colleague create a single character in each iteration of a loop, and the loop ran so many times that the system ran out of memory with just a single character. So watch your variable usage.</p>
<p>Now, probably the most common type of loop is the for loop, but it&#39;s worth having a few considerations before deciding whether a for loop is the right type of loop for the code that you want to write. Now, first, it&#39;s important to understand that a for loop is most useful when counting is straightforward. Remember that with a for loop, the idea is that you start at a certain index, usually zero, and you count up or down to another value. The loop terminates when you reach your target count.</p>
<p>Now, what that means is that a for loop requires upfront knowledge of how many iterations you&#39;re going to want to do. And that&#39;s why the most common implementation for a for loop is to start at zero, count upwards by one until you reach the size of a given list. If you don&#39;t know how many iterations you need to do, then the for loop is probably not a good choice. And that&#39;s where the while loop comes in. You should consider using a while loop when you don&#39;t exactly know how many iterations you need to make.</p>
<p>That strategy eliminates the limitations of a for loop. So imagine that you had a program that took any arbitrary number from a user and you wanted to see how many times you could divide that number by two until you got a value that was less than one. In that scenario, you could be running the loop any number of times, right? Well, you couldn&#39;t do that with a for loop. So your best bet is to use a while loop. Now, you can still trip while loops in the same count-based iteration strategy as a for loop. You just have to code the iteration inside the loop rather than its definition.</p>
<p>So we&#39;ll still easily permit iterations of collections. Now, there&#39;s an additional kind of advanced and embedded looping strategy that you can use, and that&#39;s a for each loop with Lambda expressions associated with list objects. The idea behind the for each loop is that all list objects include a for each method. And if you call that method, you can provide a Lambda expression, which is like an inline method. And that code will be executed against everything you have in the list object.</p>
<p>It&#39;s super handy and worth reading about, but it&#39;s also a little bit more advanced. Now the benefits of the for each loop is that it fully encapsulates the iteration. In other words, there&#39;s no need to create any code for iteration. You don&#39;t need to specify iterators or conditions. It will simply call your code for each item that you have in your list. Now, the code that you can create for each iteration operation is contained in what&#39;s called a Lambda expression.</p>
<p>Lambda is very powerful and definitely something I recommend looking into. It can greatly shrink and simplify your code, but watch out. It can also lead to code that looks like it&#39;s small and useful, but actually ends up being very detrimental to your overall performance. But that&#39;s ok, because while the for each loop is handy, there&#39;s a nice middle ground, and that&#39;s the enhanced for loop strategy.</p>
<p>The enhanced for loop strategy is much more convenient than a regular for loop. Rather than providing an iterator, a condition, and an incrementation strategy, all you have to do is provide a list that you want to iterate over. Now, that sounds an awful lot like the for each loop, doesn&#39;t it? Well, that&#39;s because it is actually almost identical. While a for each loop requires a list object, an enhanced for loop can be used against any type of list or an array.</p>
<p>Now, the code for enhanced for loops is nice and clean, too. It&#39;s not as condensed as a for each loop, but it&#39;s pretty close. Now, the main idea of an enhanced for loop is effectively to take the concept of a common for loop implementation and then put all of the iteration and condition work in the background.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_11" /><h2 class="section_title">12.

<p>Sometimes with loops, you want to have some extra control in how they&#39;re executing. Well with Java, there are two types of statements that you can execute that will impact how or even if a loop executes. Those statements are break and continue. So let&#39;s go over these in a bit more detail. First, we have break statements. Now, the purpose of a break statement is to immediately terminate a loop. Imagine a scenario where you have a list of items and you&#39;re trying to find whether or not something exists in that list.</p>
<p>So you start iterating over the list and halfway through you find the item. Now, you don&#39;t want to continue processing the entire list, do you? I mean, you&#39;ve already found the item. So what you can do is use the break statement to terminate the loop once you&#39;ve found the item you&#39;re looking for. Now, when the break statement is executed, it ends the loop and sends the program to the next line of code after the loop for execution. Now, to illustrate a break statement, consider this flowchart. Java encounters a loop and begins executing the code statements in that loop.</p>
<p>Now, per usual, the loop has a set of conditions that control the loop. If the condition is true, the loop will continue. But if the condition is false, the loop terminates. Well, one of the code statements inside the loop can bypass that entire process. If the break statement is called, Java will immediately terminate the loop and bypass any of the other code or condition checks that might be defined. So let&#39;s go over an example that shows the break statement in action.</p>
<p>In this code snippet, we create an array of strings called colorList. Inside is a set of colors, &#34;red&#34;, &#34;green&#34;, &#34;blue&#34;, &#34;yellow&#34;, and &#34;orange&#34;. Now, after the array definition, we use an enhanced for loop to iterate over all the colors in the list. Now during each iteration, the current color from the list is put in the variable named color. Now, inside the loop, there&#39;s a simple if condition. It checks to see if the current color being processed is equal to the value &#34;yellow&#34;.</p>
<p>And if it is, then a break statement is called, and the loop will immediately terminate. If it isn&#39;t, the loop continues on. Now, after the if condition, there&#39;s a simple print-line command that outputs the current color to the console. So what happens with this code is that it iterates over each color but stops if it sees the color yellow. And that means the output would be red, green and blue. Yellow would kill the loop and so we&#39;d never see it or orange.</p>
<p>Now, another loop controlling statement in Java is the continue statement. The purpose of the continue statement is to skip a single iteration. So imagine a scenario where you&#39;re processing some items in a list and you realize that an item in the list is not worth being processed. Now, in that situation, you could call the continue keyword, and that would immediately end the current iteration of the loop and send the loop to the next iteration.</p>
<p>Now, the important difference between the break and continue statements is that a break statement kills the whole loop, but the continue statement resumes loop processing just at the next iteration. So to illustrate a continue statement, consider this flowchart. Java encounters a loop and begins executing the code statements in that loop. Now, per usual, the code has a set of conditions that control the loop. Now, if the condition is true, the loop will continue.</p>
<p>But if the condition is false, the loop terminates. Well, one of the code statements inside the loop can bypass a single iteration. If the continue statement is called, Java will immediately bypass any other code or condition checks that it might have defined for the current iteration and immediately move on to the next iteration of the loop. Now, let&#39;s go over an example that shows the continue statement in action. In this code snippet, just like the code we had for the break statement before we create an array of strings called colorList.</p>
<p>Now, inside is a set of colors, &#34;red&#34;, &#34;green&#34;, &#34;blue&#34;, &#34;yellow&#34;, and &#34;orange&#34;. Now, after the array definition, we use an enhanced for loop to iterate over all the colors in the list. And during each iteration of the list, the current color from the list is put into the variable named color. Now, inside the loop, there&#39;s another simple if condition. It checks to see if the current color being processed is equal to the value &#34;yellow&#34;.</p>
<p>Now, if it is, then a continue statement is called and the loop will immediately move on to the next iteration of the loop. If it isn&#39;t yellow, then the rest of the statements in the loop are run. Now, after the if condition, there&#39;s a simple print-line command that outputs the current color to the console. So what happens with this code is that it iterates over each color, but effectively skips a beat if it sees the color yellow.</p>
<p>And that means that the output will be red, green, blue, and orange. Yellow would not be seen, because that iteration of the loop was skipped and orange is seen because we didn&#39;t break out of the loop completely. We just skipped to the next iteration.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_12" /><h2 class="section_title">13.

<p>In this demo, we&#39;re going to work through an example of a break statement and another example of a continue statement in Java. To do that, we&#39;re going to use the break statement while performing a search for a value in an array. And then we&#39;re going to use the continue statement to skip unwanted values in an array. Now, to do all that, we&#39;re going to piggyback off our previous demo, which we built in Eclipse. So let&#39;s head over to the IDE now.</p>
<p>All right, so I already have our project open from the previous demo, but if you don&#39;t, go ahead and open the project now. All right. So we&#39;re going to be using our main class and we can access it by double-clicking on the Main.java file in the Package Explorer panel, on the left-hand side of the screen. And I&#39;ve already got mine open. OK, so in all of our demos so far, we created some loops that iterated over some values in an array that we created during our very first demo. Some loops went through the array forwards and some went backwards.</p>
<p>But all the loops iterated through all of the items in the list. In this demo, we&#39;re going to iterate over items in the list again, but we&#39;re going to break out of our loops or skip certain items when we do it. So let&#39;s get started. Ok, so the first thing we&#39;re going to want to do is drop-down a couple of lines from our last do...while loop and add a line of code to put a break in the console. So let&#39;s type System.out.println(&#34;&#34;) and a ; good. Now, let&#39;s start by creating a for loop.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s type the following code on the next line. for(int i &#61; 0; i &lt; colors.length; i&#43;&#43;) and then the {. Excellent. Now, you&#39;ll recognize that what this for loop is doing is iterating for as many times as there are items in our list of colors. So what we want to do now is check to see if a particular color exists in our list. So let&#39;s add a simple if statement inside the loop. Let&#39;s type the following code. if(colors[i] &#61;&#61; &#34;green&#34;) and then {. Now what this condition is doing is it&#39;s asking if the color value in the loop&#39;s current index is green.</p>
<p>If it is, then the code inside the if statement will be executed. So let&#39;s add some code inside the if statement. Let&#39;s add System.out.print(&#34;found&#34;) and a ; perfect. Now, if the value of green is anywhere inside the list, we&#39;ll see the text found output to the console, but we&#39;re not quite done yet. Let&#39;s add another line of code after the if statement. So in the line after the if statement&#39;s closing squiggly bracket let&#39;s add this code.</p>
<p>System.out.print(i) and the ; now, all this code is doing is it&#39;s outputting the current index to the console. So the way this code works is that the index value will always be printed to the console, and the found text will only be output, if the value of green is found in the list. So let&#39;s execute this code and see what happens. We can do that by saving the file with a Ctrl&#43;S and running the project with a Ctrl&#43;F11.</p>
<p>Excellent. So we can see in our console output at the bottom of the screen that indexes 0, 1, and 2 were output, followed by the word found and then indexes 3, 4, and 5. And that means that the color green was found and it was at index three. Of course, we already knew it would be found in that list and we already know it&#39;s at index three. Now, the important part of what we&#39;re seeing here is that even though the color green was found in the list at index three, the rest of the array was still scanned.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s wasted processing because we already found what we were looking for. So what we want to do instead is tell Java to terminate the loop if we found what we wanted. So let&#39;s do that. Now inside the if statement, but after our print command, let&#39;s add the following code. break; Good. Now, let&#39;s save and run this. Hey, nice. This time, we still got the text found, but we can see that we didn&#39;t see any more indexes output to the screen and that shows that Java terminated the loop right when we told it to.</p>
<p>Excellent. Now let&#39;s explore the continue statement. Let&#39;s drop down another line after our latest for loop and add a print line command one last time. System.out.println(&#34;&#34;); Good. And now let&#39;s create another for loop exactly like the one that we just created. for(int i &#61; 0; colors.length; i&#43;&#43;) and the {. Good. Now let&#39;s add the same if statement that checks for the color green. if(colors[i] &#61;&#61; &#34;green&#34;) and then the {. Now once again, let&#39;s add a console output inside that if statement. System.out.print(&#34;found&#34;) and of course our semicolon.</p>
<p>And finally, let&#39;s output the color at our current index after the if statement. So let&#39;s type System.out.print(colors[i] &#43; &#34; &#34;) and of course, the semicolon. Excellent. Now if we save and run this, we&#39;ll get all the colors in our list output to the console, just like we&#39;ve seen in the past. The difference will be that we&#39;ll also get the word found whenever the color green is found. In fact, let&#39;s run and see this.</p>
<p>Hey, and there it is. Blue, white, red, foundgreen, yellow, and orange. So just like last time, the important part of what we&#39;re seeing here is that every index is being processed, and that means that every color is being displayed in the console. But what if we really despise the color green and we want to skip processing it altogether? Well, that&#39;s where the continue statement comes in.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s replace our found print statement with just the following code. [Video description begins] <em>The host deletes line 68 and replaces the code.</em> [Video description ends] continue; Now, what this code does is that any time the color at the current index is equal to green, the loop will immediately skip to the next iteration. In fact, let&#39;s run the code and see what we get. Hey, perfect. So now we&#39;re seeing all the colors output to the screen except the color green. So you can see it didn&#39;t stop. It kept going and that&#39;s why we get the color orange. Great job.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><a name="section_13" /><h2 class="section_title">14.
